1870,Hayao Miyazaki,1941-01-05 00:00:00+00:00,66679,"Miyazaki, the second of four brothers, was born in the town of Akebono-cho, part of Tokyo's Bunkyō-ku. During World War II, Miyazaki's father Katsuji was director of Miyazaki Airplane, owned by his brother (Hayao Miyazaki's uncle), which made rudders for A6M Zero fighter planes. During this time, Miyazaki drew airplanes and developed a lifelong fascination with aviation, a penchant that later manifested as a recurring theme in his films.

Miyazaki's mother was a voracious reader who often questioned socially accepted norms. Miyazaki later said that he inherited his questioning and skeptical mind from her. His mother underwent treatment for spinal tuberculosis from 1947 until 1955, and so the family moved frequently. Miyazaki's film My Neighbor Totoro is set in that time period and features a family whose mother is similarly afflicted.

Miyazaki attended Toyotama High School. In his third year there, he saw the film Hakujaden, which has been described as ""the first-ever Japanese feature length color anime."" His interest in animation began in this period; however, in order to become an animator, he had to learn to draw the human figure, since his prior work had been limited to airplanes and battleships.

After high school, Miyazaki attended Gakushuin University, from which he would graduate in 1963 with degrees in political science and economics. He was a member of the ""Children's Literature research club,"" the ""closest thing to a comics club in those days.""

In April 1963, Miyazaki got a job at Toei Animation, working as an in-between artist on the anime Watchdog Bow Wow (Wanwan Chushingura). He was a leader in a labor dispute soon after his arrival, becoming chief secretary of Toei's labor union in 1964.

In October 1965, he married fellow animator Akemi Ota, who later left work to raise their two sons, Gorō and Keisuke. Gorō is now an animator and filmmaker, and has directed Tales from Earthsea at Studio Ghibli. Keisuke is a wood artist who has created pieces for the Ghibli Museum and who made the wood engraving shown in the Studio Ghibli film Whisper of the Heart.

Hayao Miyazaki's dedication to his work has often been reported to have impacted negatively his relationship with his son Gorō. He has expressed that he doesn't wish to create a dynasty of animators and that his son has to create a name for himself.

Koyasu is also the creator of the Weiß series, and has authored the manga Weiß Side B. In creating Weiß Kreuz, Koyasu was inspired by an old Japanese series called Sure Death.

Koyasu often voices under the pseudonym Hayato Jumonji, especially in H anime.

1868,Kentarou Miura,1966-07-11 00:00:00+00:00,21439,"Date of Death: May 6, 2021

Kentarou Miura was born in Chiba City, Chiba Prefecture, Japan in 1966. He was left-handed. In 1976, at the early age of 10, Miura made his first manga, titled Miuranger, that was published for his classmates in a school publication; the manga ended up spanning 40 volumes. In 1977, Miura created his second manga titled Ken e No Michi (The Way to the Sword), using Indian ink for the first time. When he was in middle school in 1979, Miura's drawing techniques improved greatly as he started using professional drawing techniques. His first doujinshi was published, with the help of friends, in a magazine in 1982. That same year, Miura enrolled in an artistic curriculum in high school, where he and his classmates started publishing their works in school booklets, as well as having his first doujinshi published in a fan-produced magazine. In 1985, Miura applied for the entrance examination of an art college in Nihon University. He submitted Futanabi for examination and was granted admission. This project was later nominated for the Best New Author work in Weekly Shounen Magazine. Another Miura manga titled Noa was published in Weekly Shounen Magazine the very same year. Due to a disagreement with one of the editors, the manga was stalled and eventually dropped altogether. This is approximately when Miura's career hit a slump.

In 1988, Miura bounced back with a 48-page manga known as Berserk Prototype, as an introduction to the current Berserk fantasy world. It went on to win Miura a prize from the Comi Manga School. In 1989, after receiving a doctorate degree, Kentarou started a project titled Ourou (King of Wolves), based on a script by Buronson, the writer of Hokuto no Ken. It was published in Monthly Animal House magazine in issues 5 and 7 of that year.

In 1990, a sequel was made to Ourou titled Ourouden that was published as a prequel to the original in Young Animal magazine. In the same year, the 6th issue of Monthly Animal House, the first volume of the solo project Berserk was released with a relatively limited success. Miura again collaborated with Buronson on a manga titled Japan that was published in Young Animal from the 1st issue to the 8th of 1992, and was later released as a stand-alone tankoubon. Miura's fame grew after Berserk was serialized in Young Animal in 1992 with the release of ""The Golden Age"" story arc, and the huge success of his masterpiece made of him one of the most prominent contemporary mangaka. At this time, Miura dedicated himself solely to work on Berserk. He indicated, however, that he intended to publish more manga in the future.

In 1997, Miura supervised the production of 25 anime episodes of Berserk that aired in the same year on NTV. Various art books and supplemental materials by Miura based on Berserk were also released. In 1999, Miura made minor contributions to the Dreamcast video game Sword of the Berserk: Guts' Rage. 2004 saw the release of yet another video game adaptation titled Berserk Millennium Falcon Arc: Chapter of the Record of the Holy Demon War.

The Berserk manga has also spawned a whole host of merchandise, both official and fan-made, ranging from statues and action figures to key rings, video games, and a trading card game. In 2002, Kentarou Miura received second place in the Osamu Tezuka Culture Award of Excellence for Berserk.

Miura provided the designs for the Vocaloid Kamui Gakupo, whose voice is taken from the Japanese singer and actor, Gackt.

Height: 155 cm
Blood type: B

Her real name is Horie Yoshiko (堀江 由子), and she is sometimes affectionately nicknamed ""Hocchan"" by her Japanese fans.

She hosts a radio show called ""Horie Yui no Tenshi no Tamago"" and is the founding member of the singing group, Aice⁵. She is also a member of the band Kurobara Hozonkai, with the name Yuiel. Her hobbies include shoulder massage, reading and cooking.

As a child, she was a huge fan of the anime series Dirty Pair and has later stated that the series was her first inspiration to become a voice artist.

She debuted in 1997 in a video game Voice Fantasia and for several years had minor roles in various anime. She landed her first leading role as Haruka in Kurogane Communication. The turning point in her career wasn't till the year 2000, when she won the role of Narusegawa Naru in the popular anime Love Hina. Other notable and defining career moments were taking the role of Honda Tooru in the anime Fruits Basket in 2001, and releasing her 1st music album (Mizutamari ni Utsuru Sekai) in 2000. She has since become one of the most popular anime voice actresses in Japan.

Horie formed a temporary unit called Yamato Nadeshiko with the popular seiyuu Tamura Yukari in 2001. They released two singles, Mou Hitori no Watashi and Merry Merrily—the latter of which was an insert song in the Love Hina Christmas Special: Silent Eve.

In October, 2005 she founded Aice⁵, a J-Pop group consisting of 4 other seiyuu, to help launch their careers. Aice⁵ was officially disbanded on September 20, 2007.

She has collaborated with a few other artists, such as Unscandal in 2005 and Kurobara Hozonkai, a Japanese Goth band, in 2007.

She was employed by Arts Vision until mid-2007 due to a scandal within the agency's top management, at which point she left to become a freelance seiyuu unaffiliated with any talent management firm.

She has published 6 independent musical albums. Nearly all of them incorporate at least one track from an anime she has worked with. She currently releases music under the Starchild label (a subdivision of King Records).

1904,Hideaki Sorachi,1979-05-25 00:00:00+00:00,8888,"Hideaki Sorachi (空知英秋, Sorachi Hideaki?, born May 25, 1979) is a Japanese manga artist best known for his work Gintama.

According to his reply to a manga reader (Gintama Volume 11), he was quite interested in manga during childhood days. However at grade 4 in school he showed his work to his father who promptly laughed at it, after which Sorachi temporarily abandoned his aims of being a manga artist. After graduation, he could not find a job, thus he turned to drawing manga (which he had already learned in university). He was able to gain some recognition through his first work Dandylion and subsequently progressed in his career (the comic is shown in the first volume of Gintama, with a foreword by Hideaki stating that it was his first work).

In 2003, Sorachi's editor attempted to coax him to create a new series due to a new television program on the Shinsengumi airing on Japanese TV the next year. Yet Sorachi's original idea was to ride on the coattails of the Harry Potter franchise with a series about a school for demon dispellers. After several arguments and an attempt to write the Shinsengumi series, Sorachi gave up, took what he had of the script and twisted it to become the pseudo-historical science fiction series Gintama. (stated in Gintama Volume 1)

Hideaki Sorachi holds a degree in commercial advertising (again, stated in volume 11).

It consists of leader Nanase Ohkawa, and three artists whose roles shift for each series: Mokona, Tsubaki Nekoi, and Satsuki Igarashi. Almost 100 million Clamp tankōbon copies have been sold worldwide as of October 2007.

Beginning as an eleven-member dōjinshi circle in the mid-1980s, they began creating original work in 1987. By the time they debuted with RG Veda in 1989, the group was reduced to seven members. In 1993, three more members left, leaving the four members who are currently still part of the group. In 2006, the members decided to change their names; Ohkawa later changed her name back from Ageha Ohkawa to Nanase Ohkawa, while the other three members retained their new names.

14441,Sumire Uesaka,1991-12-19 00:00:00+00:00,4479,"Birth place: Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan
Blood type: O

Uesaka Sumire is a voice actress currently affiliated with Space Craft Entertainment. Because of her interest in Russia she is also affectionately known under the nickname Sumipe (すみぺ, the letter R resembles a P in Russia's Cyrillic Alphabet). Other nicknames include Suminya (スミーニャ), because she likes to wear nekomimi accessory, and Gundanchou (軍団長, Corps Commander) because of her interest in military, especially tanks, and her radio show.

At the age of eight Uesaka was scouted by Space Craft Junior Commercial Talent right when she was going home after an EIKEN Test in Practical English Proficiency. Afterwards she appeared in a Japanese Vidal Sassoon CM. In 2009 she took part in the Web Radio@Dengeki Bunko web radio, where she became a regular between September 2009 and December 2011. During her work there she wanted to breath life into her work, which became one of her inspirations to aspire to become a voice actress. Her other inspiration was voice actress Momoi Haruko, who she respects after she incidentally saw Nurse Witch Komugi-chan Magikarte when she was still a primary school student. Uesaka described the experience as shocking but it was there that she heard Momoi for the first time and yearned to become a voice actress afterwards. In April, 2011 she joined Space Craft Entertainment's anime section. Starting October 7, 2011 she became a radio personality on A&amp;G NEXT GENERATION Lady Go!!. Following an announcement on August 12 of the same year at the Summer Comic Market 80, it was announced that she had being casted on the 2012 TV anime series Papa no Iukoto wo Kikinasai!. In January 2012 she made her debut as voice actress, lending her voice to the heroine Takanashi Sora. Later Matsu Tomohiro, the original author, and Kawasaki Itsurou, the director, said that she was chosen at the audition despite technical flaws, because they couldn't picture anyone else as Sora. Following her first starring role she became gradually more busy during 2012.

Uesaka is an avid fan of Russia and its history, culture, military, literature and art. This traces back to the time when she was a tenth grade student, in her first year of high school, and heard by chance for the first time the Soviet Union national anthem. Henceforth she began to develop an interest in Russia and devoted herself to studying about Russian society and history on her own. She couldn't picture herself studying anything other than Russian language at university. In April 2010, she entered the Faculty of Foreign Studies at the well known Sophia University after a recommendation from Kamakura Women's University Junior &amp; Senior High School where she graduated. There she was majoring in Russian Studies. Her graduation thesis was a study of the early history of the Red Army. On July 10, 2012 she received Sophia University's Studies Prize For Excellent Work.

Starting April, 2012 she received her own radio show, the Uesaka Sumire's Armored Guards Infantry Regiment Broadcast on Nico Nico Live. Because of her familiarity with Russia and interest in its military, she was casted as the Russian girl Nonna on TV anime series Girls und Panzer in October 2012. She also sung two Russian insert songs during the show, ""Cossack no Komoriuta"" and ""Katyusha,"" both covers of well known folk songs. Her performance as voice actress and singer received a lot of attention in Japan and overseas thereafter.

Uesaka likes to study languages and is, aside of Russian, proficient in English and Chinese as well, having passed several language proficiency tests. She also likes Lolita Fashion and as such became a model for the Baby, The Stars Shine Bright clothing brand. Photo shoots with her are published frequently in Kera, Gothic &amp; Lolita Bible and other well known magazines. She likes to draw and often posts illustrations on her blog and pixiv account. Her favorite food includes lamb chop and Kinoko no Yama. Her favorite politician is Vyacheslav Molotov, her favorite manga and anime characters are Chirico Cuvie, Duke Tougou and Rudolf von Stroheim. Her favorite tank is the BT-5 produced by the Soviet Union. On May 26, 2012 she served as a one-day captain of the JS Yamayuki at the Marine Fiesta in Funabashi.

1891,Rumiko Takahashi,1957-10-10 00:00:00+00:00,4002,"Hometown: Niigata, Niigata, Japan
Blood type: A+'
Zodiac: Libra

Rumiko Takahashi is one of the wealthiest women in Japan. The manga she creates (and its anime adaptations) are very popular in the United States and Europe where they have been released as both manga and anime in English translation. Her works are relatively famous worldwide, and many of her series were some of the forerunners of early English language manga to be released in the nineties. Takahashi is also the best selling female comics artist in history; well over 100 million copies of her various works have been sold.

Though she was said to occasionally doodle in the margins of her papers while attending Niigata Chuuou High School, Takahashi's interest in manga did not come until later. During her college years, she enrolled in Gekiga Sonjuku, a manga school founded by Kazuo Koike, mangaka of Crying Freeman and Lone Wolf and Cub. Under his guidance Rumiko Takahashi began to publish her first doujinshi creations in 1975, such as Bye-Bye Road and Star of Futile Dust. Kozue Koike often urged his students to create well-thought out, interesting characters, and this influence would greatly impact Rumiko Takahashi's works throughout her career.

Career and major works:

Takahashi's professional career began in 1978. Her first published story was Those Selfish Aliens, a comedic science fiction story. During the same year, she published Time Warp Trouble, Shake Your Buddha, and the Golden Gods of Poverty in Shounen Sunday, which would remain the home to most of her major works for the next twenty years. Later that year, Rumiko attempted her first full-length series, Urusei Yatsura. Though it had a rocky start due to publishing difficulties, Urusei Yatsura would become one of the most beloved anime and manga comedies in Japan.

In 1980, Rumiko Takahashi found her niche and began to publish with regularity. At this time she started her second major series, Maison Ikkoku, in Big Comic Spirits. Written for an older audience, Maison Ikkoku is often considered to be one of the all-time best romance manga. Takahashi managed to work on Maison Ikkoku on and off simultaneously with Urusei Yatsura. She concluded both series in 1987, with Urusei Yatsura ending at 34 volumes, and Maison Ikkoku being 15.

During the 1980s, Takahashi became a prolific writer of short story manga, which is surprising considering the massive lengths of most of her works. Her stories The Laughing Target, Maris the Chojo, and Fire Tripper all were adapted into original video animations (OVAs). In 1984, after the end of Urusei Yatsura and Maison Ikkoku, Takahashi took a different approach to storytelling and began the dark, macabre Mermaid Saga. This series of short segments was published sporadically until 1994, with the final story being Mermaid's Mask. Many fans contend that this work remains unfinished by Takahashi, since the final story does not end on a conclusive note.

Another short work left untouched is One-Pound Gospel, which, like Mermaid Saga, was published erratically. The last story to be drawn was published in 2001, however just recently she wrote one final chapter concluding the series

Later in 1987, Takahashi began her third major series, Ranma ½. Following the late 80s and early 90s trend of shounen martial arts manga, Ranma ½ features a gender-bending twist. The series continued for nearly a decade until 1996, when it ended at 38 volumes. Ranma ½ is one of Rumiko Takahashi's most popular series with the Western world.

During the later half of the 1990s, Rumiko Takahashi continued with short stories and her installments of Mermaid Saga and One-Pound Gospel until beginning her fourth major work, InuYasha. While Ranma ½, Urusei Yatsura, and Maison Ikkoku all were heavily seated in the romantic comedy genre, InuYasha was more akin to her dark Mermaid Saga. The series became her most eclectic work, featuring action, romance, horror, fantasy, (folklore-based) historical fiction, and comedy.

1938,Osamu Tezuka,1928-11-03 00:00:00+00:00,3996,"Died: February 9, 1989 (aged 60)
Birth place: Toyonaka, Osaka Prefecture, Japan

Tezuka was a Japanese manga artist, cartoonist, animator, and film producer. His prolific output, pioneering techniques, and innovative redefinitions of genres earned him such titles as ""the father of manga,"" ""the godfather of manga"" and ""the god of manga."" Additionally, he is often considered the Japanese equivalent to Walt Disney, who served as a major inspiration during Tezuka's formative years.

Tezuka began what was known as the manga revolution in Japan with his New Treasure Island published in 1947. His legendary output would spawn some of the most influential, successful, and well-received manga series including Tetsuwan Atom, Jungle Taitei, Black Jack, and Hi no Tori, all of which won several awards.

Tezuka died of stomach cancer in 1989. His death had an immediate impact on the Japanese public and other cartoonists. A museum was constructed in Takarazuka dedicated to his memory and life works, and Tezuka received many posthumous awards. Several animations were in production at the time of his death along with the final chapters of Hi no Tori, which were never released.

5251,Asian Kung-Fu Generation,,3274,"Asian Kung-Fu Generation is a Japanese rock band formed in Yokohama, Japan in 1996. For nearly its entire career, the band has consisted of vocalist Masafumi Gotoh, guitarist Kensuke Kita, bassist Takahiro Yamada, and drummer Kiyoshi Ijichi. The band's musical style is influenced by seminal Western punk and alternative rock acts in conjunction with their own local Japanese indie rock background. As a result, their songs maintain a balance of various aspects of the genres, most typically expressing fast-paced tempos and prominent, hard-edged guitar riffs as well as rhythmic flow and emotional lyrics. Despite the indie nature of their music, the band has enjoyed worldwide commercial success in addition to critical acclaim.

She states that she has always been close to music; be it from her mother's car stereo or the radio, she would remember the tunes and sing along.

Her professional career began in March 2004 when, at the recommendation of her juku instructors, she applied for an audition hosted by Sony Music Japan. Despite the audition rule that a participant could only perform two songs, Yui was allowed to sing three. She first sang ""Why Me"" (a song later included in her debut single), followed by ""It's Happy Line"" and ""I Know."" The judges gave her the maximum score, causing a fierce scramble among record labels to sign her.[citation needed] Because ""I Know"" was incomplete at the time, the judges were able to get a glimpse of what would later be dubbed ""Yui-go,"" or Yui-speak (Yui語 in Japanese), nonsensical English hummed to a tune during her songwriting process—an example of Yui-go can be found in the film Midnight Sun when Yui is working on the song ""Goodbye Days.""

On December 24, 2004, she released her debut single ""It's Happy Line"" under indie label Leaflet Records, coupled with the track ""I Know."" The pressing was limited to only 2,000 copies in her home area.

The Associated Press has reported that her full name is Yui Yoshioka.

Since May 4, 2013, she is a vocalist of FLOWER FLOWER as yui.

Mafumafu likes to add effects to his voice and scream loudly in his covers. Mafumafu has a very wide vocal range and a versatile voice, having the ability to hit and leap into high notes effortlessly, sometimes to feminine range, without sounding strained or loosing the softness in his voice. However, he also sounds pleasant when he sings songs in his regular and lower voice, which can sound relaxing and quite soothing. On some of his covers, many people are often confused and argue about his gender when he utilizes his higher register, therefore making him a ryouserui. Because of his high vocal range, he is also capable of producing a very convincing female voice, most clearly seen in his cover of ""Matryoshka""Nv.He often makes use of his wide range in his covers by leaping into higher or lower octaves to match the tone of the song.

Occasionally he forgets some of the lyrics and either mumbles or makes cute noises until the next line. His songs are often tagged as someone with a ""kakuseirui"" (覚声類, lit. energizing voice).

He is also a mixer and often mixes songs for other utaite as well. He started as a Producer for VOCALOID originals.

She writes BL manga and yaoi doujinshi under the pen-name Rock Yanao. Yana is her real first name, but Toboso is not her real surname. In reality, ""Yana"" and ""Toboso"" are both different ways to pronounce ""kururu"" (枢), which means ""to pivot/turn.""

Toboso often likes to bring up her dislike for being mistakenly called ""Yana Hitsugi"" by her fans, as the kanji for Hitsugi means ""coffin"" (柩) but looks similar in appearance for the kanji for ""toboso.""

Her assistants include Satorigi Akiyo, Hazuki Wakana and her editor is Kuma Takeshi, a former mangaka. She is friends with manga artist, Fujiwara Cocoa.

Yana Toboso draws herself as a devil with a black body and horns, a round white head, and a pointed tail. She has never showed a real picture of herself, so her actual appearance is unknown.

Before Volume 4, Toboso's devil had hair. Though, she later states that she had a bald spot the size of a ¥10 coin.

He moved to Tokyo in 1973 and made his debut in comics the same year, with ""Jyu-sei"" (""A Gun Report""), an adaptation of the Prosper Mérimée novella ""Mateo Falcone."" After this, he frequently published his work in magazine Action.

In 1979, Otomo's first longer publication appeared—a series called ""Fireball,"" which was a great success for its ground-breaking style, which changed traditional manga forever. This was the beginning of Otomo's interest in science-fiction themes. In 1980, Otomo's ""Domu"" became a best-seller and won Japan's Science Fiction Grand Prix Award. In 1982, Otomo came up with the comic series ""Akira,"" which was first published in magazine Young. It was an immediate success and grew into an epic tale. It has won numerous awards and is regarded by many as the finest work of graphic fiction ever created. It has been published in the West as well, where it has been met with just as much enthusiasm. He is also a fan of James Dean's ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""

Blood type: B
Doujin circle: LEVEL-X

Ken Akamatsu is a Japanese mangaka. He is married to his wife ""Kanon"" Akamatsu, who was previously a singer/idol.

In his teenage years, Akamatsu failed the entrance exam to Tokyo University, and applied for Film Study instead (it is speculated that this is where he got the idea for Love Hina). Eventually, he became famous as an illustrator featured in Comiket. He used the pen name Awa Mizuno. Akamatsu, still in college, then proceeded to win the Weekly Shonen Magazine award twice. His A Kid's Game for One Summer was awarded the coveted 50th Shonen Magazine Newcomer's Award soon after he graduated.

After a big hit with A.I. Love You, he finally made a grand success with his new manga Love Hina, which received the Kodansha Manga Award for shounen in 2001. Akamatsu had added elements of his own life experiences to the story, and this was said to have induced a unique feeling to the manga especially for Western readers, whose lack of familiarity with Japanese culture for the most part added to the effect.

Produced by Mana (MALICE MIZER～Moi dix Mois), Wakeshima debuted under the DefSTAR Records label on May 28, 2008 with the single ""Still Doll,"" the ending theme for the anime adaptation of the manga series Vampire Knight. She also provided the voice for a maid that appears in the eighth episode of the series. Wakeshima's second single ""Suna no Oshiro"" (砂のお城), released on November 12, 2008, was used as the ending theme for the series' second season.

She was nominated for a Best Newcomer award for 2008 in the fourth annual Shojo Beat Music Awards, nominees of which are determined by surveying ""record companies, music journalists, music experts, and music fans.""

Before her birth, Wakeshima's music loving parents wished for her to be a musician. At the age of three, she began learning the cello beginning her entry into the world of music. In junior high school she formed her own ensemble group. At the age of fifteen, she transitioned from her former classical ensembles into playing in the baroque section. Appearing in a variety of recitals and concerts throughout her school years, she began writing her own music and combining singing with her cello playing at the age of sixteen. As she transitioned from junior high school to high school, she began writing her own music and singing. She gave her first vocal performances during a high school festival.

Wakeshima auditioned at Sony Music Entertainment as a singer, originally not intending to include her cello playing with her demo tape, but later changing her mind after experimenting with performing with the piano. She became a finalist at the audition, contracting with the Sony subsidiary DefSTAR Records and debuting on May 28, 2008 with her first single, ""Still Doll."" The single was chosen to be used for the ending theme of the first season of the anime adaptation of the manga series Vampire Knight.

She uses three cellos, one for performing, one for music videos and one for recording. Wakeshima has given each cello a name. The white cello is known as Mikazuki-san which means ""crescent moon."" This is the cello she is normally seen performing on during live performances. The red cello is known as ""Nanachie-san"" which means wisdom. This is the cello commonly seen in her music videos. According to Wakeshima, Nanachie-san is very hard to play but she manages. Her third cello is a brown cello called ""Yaeharu-san"" which means ""multi-layered spring."" Yaeharu-san is very special to Wakeshima since it is the cello she had since middle school and is the one she practices on and records with. Currently, she had a new silver cello named ""Momotose.""",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/3640.jpg

At 17, he made his first manga submission to Shonen Jump, but it was considered by the editors to be too graphic for the weekly magazine's format and was subsequently rejected. Maruo temporarily removed himself from manga until November of 1980 when he made his official debut as a manga artist in Ribon no Kishi at the age of 24. It was at this stage that the young artist was finally able to pursue his artistic vision without such stringent restrictions over the visual content of his work. Two years later, his first stand-alone anthology, Barairo no Kaibutsu (Rose Colored Monster) was published.\n
\n
Maruo was a frequent contributor to the legendary underground manga magazine Garo.\n
\n
Like many manga artists, Maruo sometimes makes cameo appearances in his own stories. When photographed, he seldom appears without his trademark sunglasses.\n
\n
Though most prominently known for his work as a manga artist, Maruo has also produced illustrations for concert posters, CD Jackets, magazines, novels, and various other media. Some of his characters have been made into figures as well.\n
\n
Though relatively few of Maruo's manga have been published outside of Japan, his work enjoys a cult following abroad.\n
\n
His book Shoujo Tsubaki (aka Mr. Arashi's Amazing Freak Show) has been adapted into an animated film by Hiroshi Harada with a soundtrack by J.A. Seazer, but it has received very little release. In Europe it was marketed under the name Midori, after the main character. It was recently released on DVD in France by Cinemalta (the DVD includes English subtitles).\n

7749,SCANDAL,,942,"SCANDAL is a pop group formed in August, 2006. Proclaiming themselves as ""The Most Powerful Japanese Girlie Pop Rock"", they are composed of four high school girls from Osaka, Japan: 

Ono Haruna - Vocals and guitar
Ogawa Tomomi - Vocals and bass
Sasazaki Mami - Vocals and guitar 
Suzuki Rina - Vocals and drum

Scandal is very energetic, mostly due to the fact that Ono, the eldest and leader of the band, shares lead vocals with the other three members, in order to not have a focus on one girl in particular and to give each time in the limelight.

The four girls came together as music-loving high school friends to form Scandal, and decided to write and play their own songs while juggling their regular school lives. As time went on, the group started to get offers from clubs and music halls around Osaka and Kyoto.

Eventually, over one hundred fans began to consistently attend the live performances Scandal performed on Tokyo's streets and in Shiroten, Osaka, causing the band to become noticed more in the eyes of the Japanese public. In August 2007, Scandal seized the opportunity to participate in a special event at Shibuya Club Asia, a highly recognized and respected club in Shibuya. It was during this time that record label Kitty Records (a subsidiary of Kitty Films) first asked the four girls if they would like to have their music recorded with them. Several months later, the girls had worked out a flexible independent agreement with Kitty in partnership with Tower Records, and SCANDAL started to become more mainstream.

Their first indie single was released on March 3, 2008 in celebration of Girl's Day, which, despite being ranked second on Tower Record's ""Indies Weekly Chart"", sold out throughout Japan and had a hard time being kept in stock due to high demand. In an attempt to alleviate the fan's troubles in getting this album, the single was released on both the US and Japanese iTunes Music Store on April 9, 2008. Two more singles (in CD form) were released in the months following, both being ranked number 1 on the ""Indies Weekly Chart"".

Right after their first release, Scandal left Japan to go on their first international tour, ""Japan Nite US Tour 2008"", followed by two concerts at the Japanese cultural and anime convention, ""Sakura-Con 2008"" from March 16 to March 30.

Scandal's music has been featured in a range of popular media: their first single, ""Space Ranger"", is the opening to Kyoto Sports Weekly, and their second single, ""Koi Moyou"" is the main theme of the movie Corazon de Melon. Their song, ""Start"", is the theme song for Star Ocean: Second Evolution and is available on the game's soundtrack. More recently, ""Daydream"" was featured on a tribute album to the classic multi-genre Japanese band, Judy and Mary, and their song ""Shoujo S"" is the tenth opening of the anime series ""Bleach"". They are also set to compose the soundtrack for the upcoming Production I.G film Loups=Garous.

They have also been featured in commercials, promoting a line of Cecil McBee cosmetics, for Nike, featuring four different colors of their footwear, and were chosen to represent Pocari Sweat in posters and in the promotional video for their song ""BEAUTeen!"" as part of their summer 2009 campaign.

An interesting note about the group is the unique way in which they chose to promote themselves. Since they are fans of Japanese animation and manga, they wanted to be represented in animated form, turning each member into an animated character. The animated SCANDAL is featured on Japanese Television, and a series of promotional videos on the band's website.

In early September 2008, Scandal began talks with the head of Sony Music Japan due to the fact that with Kitty, their CDs were made in very limited quantities which caused them to sell out quickly. They soon worked out a contract with Sony, who signed them on to their Epic Records label, and the group moved away from the indie music scene.

Her hobbies are: motorcycle, reading, traveling and drinking. Her bloodtype is O.

As of June 2012, she was suffering from a rare autoimmune disease, due to which she decided to leave her job for an undetermined amount of time in order to take care of her health. According to news for that month, she was under her mother's care.

5631,ALI PROJECT,,782,"ALI PROJECT is a Japanese band with a strong Japanese Aristocrat-style image, consisting of Arika Takarano (宝野アリカ) (vocals &amp; lyrics) and Mikiya Katakura (片倉三起也) (music &amp; arrangement).

In the band's earlier days, their musical style tended towards light, cheerful and/or refreshing songs. However, the sound has changed in recent times to take on a darker and more mysterious tone. Takarano Arika, lead singer/lyricist, has termed this change as a transition from White Alice (白アリ) to Black Alice (黒アリ). Though there has been a general shift towards performing songs in the ""Black Alice"" phase, Ali Project has occasionally sung in the White Alice style as well.

They made their indie debut in the charts in 1988 as Ari (Ant) Project (蟻プロジェクト) with their album Fantastic Garden (幻想庭園 Gensou Teien). The album was later included in Tatsumi Takayuki's book Philosophy of Progressive Rock (プログレッシヴ・ロックの哲学), which led to the band being classified under the progressive rock genre.

Four years later in 1992 they changed their name and made their major debut with their single Fall in love, maiden (恋せよ乙女, Koiseyo Otome).

Most of their records are released by Toshiba-EMI, Victor Entertainment and Tokuma Japan. The band is notable in the anime community for having their songs featured in several anime opening and ending sequences, most notably the series Noir and Rozen Maiden.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/10126.jpg
6206,Maximum the Hormone,,778,"Striking contrasts from pop-punk to thrash-metal sum up the sound of the band. These various styles, expertly displayed through Daisuke and Ryo's screaming vocals, Ue's rhythmic slap bass, and the remarkable voice of Ryo's older sister and drummer, Nao, allow the band to fit well in several genres. The names and lyrics of their songs don't make a lot of sense, but the band doesn't want them to anyway.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/44464.jpg

11768,Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,1756-01-27 00:00:00+00:00,684,"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (27 January 1756 – 5 December 1791) was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical era. He composed over 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, piano, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers.

Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood in Salzburg. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. At 17 he was engaged as a court musician in Salzburg, but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position, always composing abundantly. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of Mozart's death. The circumstances of his early death have been much mythologized. He was survived by his wife Constanze and two sons.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/34901.jpg

Manaka Iwami was drawn to becoming a seiyuu after seeing the performance of Ai Kayano in Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai. while in middle school. Iwami was not an articulate girl growing up, so she thought she could not become a professional if she did not start studying to become a seiyuu earlier than others. She persuaded her father to allow her to attend seiyuu training school, declaring that otherwise she would not attend high school.

In 2016, Iwami was selected by audition to join the cast of Sayonara no Asa ni Yakusoku no Hana wo Kazarou as lead protagonist Maquia. The film is the directorial debut of Mari Okada, who is also the screenwriter for the aforementioned AnoHana series. As fate would have it, SayoAsa would also star Ai Kayano in a supporting role, ensuring a fateful meeting between Iwami and her role model.

Despite being selected for SayoAsa, that film would not open in theaters until 2018. Consequently, Iwami instead made her screen debut in 2017 in the television series Tsuki ga Kirei.

Although his brother and sister both played violin when they were children, he did not develop real interest music until he was thirteen. Growing up in a country town, he began taking bluegrass guitar lessons from a local teacher, John Massey. This was a big turning point in his life as it was the gateway to a new world.

As he started his studies in guitar, he developed a condition known as ""Occipital Neuralgia"" which caused incessant, extreme headaches. He could not attend school due to the pain, so he continued his studies at home and sent his work to school. As a wrestler, runner, and soccer player, this also was a big imposition not only on his academic endeavors, but also on his athletic lifestyle. During this time, as he could not do much else, he focused intensely on music. For the next three months, he spent the majority of his time playing guitar until he was able to return to school after the pain had subsided enough. However, it was not until four years later that he completely recovered.

When he was sixteen, he picked up electric guitar and learned a great deal from a good friend of his, Matt Di Giordano. At this point, he branched out from just fingerstyle guitar to metal, a genre that has had a great influence on his development as a musician. Inspired by his friend, he began to write his own music. Starting with fingerstyle tunes and metal, he eventually delved into other kinds of music, specifically orchestral music (often used in his metal tunes) and video game music.

At the same time he began playing electric guitar, he developed an interest in singing. After singing for a couple years on his own, he began taking classical lessons from a local vocal teacher, Chris Bello, and participated in a local theater production. He began to develop his technique as a classical/musical theater singer and has continued to develop over these past few years. As a voice principal at Berklee, he is branching out into other styles such as: rock, jazz, latin, etc...

His deep interest in other cultures has also had a huge influence on his music. Aside from his native language of English, he also speaks proficient Japanese and Spanish. Although not an expert, he plays other instruments such as: Sanshin, Ryuuteki, Hichiriki, Quena, Flauta Dulce, Ocarina, Balalaika, and Charango. As a film scoring major at Berklee, he continues to apply everything he has learned throughout his life to further his ability and competency in the music world.

He currently resides in Tokyo and belonged to the music production group Elements Garden until 2016.

The band got their name from the album Pornograffitti by the band Extreme. They currently record under the Sony Music Entertainment Japan Records (SME Records) label.

Haruichi Shindō originally formed the band with his cousin during high school and named it ""No Score."" After the band started, Haruichi asked Akihito Okano and Masami ""Tama"" Shiratama to join. The band was so named because none of them could actually read a score when they first started. When they first started the band, Haruichi was the vocalist, but found out that Akihito could sing better, so he gave the vocalist position to Akihito and took over as guitarist instead. This was the foundation of Porno Graffitti.

They debuted with the song Apollo in 1999. Their two subsequent CD singles, Saudade and Agehachō, both sold over a million copies in Japan. They are also well known for the song Melissa, which was used as the opening theme of the anime series Fullmetal Alchemist in 2003. They also created the song Hitori no Yoru, used as the opening theme of the anime series GTO in 2000, and Winding Road, used as the ending theme of the anime series Ayakashi Ayashi in 2006. A cover of their 2000 single Music Hour was featured in a stage of the Nintendo DS rhythm game Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan 2.

(1998) Won the ""Best Individual"" or ""Individual Achievement"" award at the 3rd Animation Kobe
Blood type: B 

Watanabe Shin'ichi (real name 渡邊慎一, same reading) was born September 6, 1964 in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. He is a director for anime and voice actor. He is best-known for his over-the-top adaptation of Rikdo Koshi's Excel Saga, in which he appears as the character Nabeshin. In addition to his appearance in Excel Saga and Puni Puni Poemy, his likeness has also appeared as NB in Tenchi Muyo! GXP, Inu-Afro in Dotto Koni-Chan and in a bit role in Mahoromatic. In addition, an unmistakable cameo of Nabeshin can be seen in Nurse Witch Komugi, although Watanabe had nothing to do with that project. He has also appeared in EyeShield 21. More recently he has made an appearance in episode 32 of Hayate no Gotoku.

Watanabe revealed that the nickname Nabeshin (which is a combination of ""nabe"" in Watanabe and ""shin"" in Shinichi) came to him from God.

Not to be confused with the director Watanabe Shin'ichirou, most known for Cowboy Bebop.

In 2015 he moved to Portugal to study at the University of Coimbra. In 2017, it was Fábio's turn to try his luck in the world of sport. After taking the entrance tests to the RUC Reporting Course, Fábio had the opportunity to learn the Portuguese sports story with great names from the Portuguese radio station. Generating great enthusiasm in the Portuguese crowd, Fábio promised a lot after mythical reports in Studio 3 of Rádio Universidade de Coimbra. The friendly match between Académica and Tondela was Lucindo's highlight at RUC, with an incredible account of the goal of the Korean midfielder KI. However, his performances were not enough to convince Mestre Gioao Rodrigues. Sad and disappointed that he was unable to join the fabulous RUC Reports (although there are controversies) Fábio returned to Brazil in 2018.

He has also done various illustrations for magazines and EroGuro work. He has an EroGuro book out that is mostly a compilation of some of the work he has created. His favourite bands are Queen, Black Sabbath and Jittarin Jin.

Art Style:
He has a good understanding of anatomy that allows him to create uniquely expressive poses and angles. His use of accurately detailed shots of hands and feet makes them almost as reflective of character and mood as his faces. Atmospheric backgrounds and landscapes round out the look of the manga, which incorporates many panels done in a finished, shaded pencil style rather than in inked line art. His superb drawing skills are shown to their best advantage in these penciled panels. This applies to most of the manga and artwork he has created. He doesn't seem to use pencils as much as he used to though, preferring a sketchy ink style instead.

Education:
Samura says that he always wanted to be a manga artist. However, unlike most mangaka, he attended art school for a time and has a classical art education. He disliked oil painting and prefers to work in black and white. He says that he disliked oil painting from the start because of the smell of the paint and employed someone to help himself cheat to get through the course, which he is quite open about in interviews. He never completed the course because he got picked up by Afternoon before he graduated to do Blade of the Immortal.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/38489.jpg

Blood type: A
Height: 160 cm
Weight: 45 kg

(2007-08-26) Married on her 30th birthday

Saeko Chiba took up ballet at a young age with ambitions of becoming part of Takarazuka Revue. However, having failed the entrance exam for Takarazuka Music School in her third year of middle-school she joined the Minami Aoyama Shōjo Kageki Dan (南青山少女歌劇団, South Aoyama Female Opera Group?, also called Nanshō for short) a stage group for teenage girls.

Having had several lead roles over the three years she spent with the troupe, Saeko was then cast in the lead voice acting role of Kotori Haruno in the Sega Dreamcast game Diamond Daydreams. Having had a taste of being a seiyū and deciding that she preferred voice acting to performing on stage, Saeko decided to pursue the career full-time.

Some of her earlier roles include her seiyū debut as Tsubaki Sakura in Kare Kano, Kitsune no Akane in Angel Tales, and Elliot Chapman in Sci-fi Harry. Saeko was famed for her long, straight, black hair and seemingly cold outward appearance which led to her being cast in various tsundere and 'cool-girl' roles. She then cut her hair short in the spring of 2005, which strangely coincided with the increasing diversity of her roles, as Saeko herself noted on the My-HiME fandisc interview.

Saeko has also pursued a singing career with Yuki Kajiura, who wrote music for some of the Nanshō stage shows, writing and producing almost all her material. Her first single was Koi no Kiseki, the theme song for the PlayStation game Meguri Aishite. She has since released nine singles and two albums, along with various character song and drama CDs. She has also performed theme songs for games such as Alundra 2 and Atelier Judie.

Saeko was also part of the group tiaraway with fellow Nanshō member Yuuka Nanri. Originally recording and performing as 'Saeko Chiba &amp; Yuuka Nanri' for Memories Off 2nd, the duo released three singles and an album before breaking up on  March 6 2005.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/54709.jpg

Most of their songs have a heavy metal element with a heavy bass line, tricky rhythms and changes in melodic keys. Although their recent songs have a slight avantgarde/alternative element (this is prominent especially in their ""anima"" album), the band has still kept its roots from their indies' days. They have also experimented with jazz, ambience, electronica, techno and bossa nova styles of music.

His work mainly includes key animation starting in the late 1980s. Iso is known for his offbeat key animation in the prologue of Gundam 0080, large portions of Asuka's battle in The End of Evangelion and the first half of Ghost in the Shell's tank battle. He also did some design work and worked on visual effects for Blood: The Last Vampire and RahXephon. Iso has co-written an episode of Neon Genesis Evangelion (""Liliputian Hitcher"") and wrote, directed, and largely animated the RahXephon episode ""The Children's Night"". He also worked as an key animator on FLCL, Memories and Only Yesterday. He wrote and directed the 2007 TV series Dennou Coil.

Mitsuo Iso is known for his jerky yet detailed animation, full of dense sophisticated motion. He refers to his own style as ""full limited"". In traditional animation, animation with a drawing count below one drawing every two frames (or ""on twos"") is considered limited animation. Mixing twos, threes and fours in a balanced form of timing, Iso draws every keyframe without passing his work to an in-betweener, allowing him full control to create the most detailed motion possible with a balanced and efficient number of drawings, hence the term ""full limited.""

Birth place: Kochenёvo, Novosibirsk, Russia

Olga Vitalevna Yakovleva, better known as ORIGA, was a Russian singer who worked mostly in Japan.

Her music studies began when she was 5 and at age 11, she was invited to appear on a children's TV program to perform a song she had written. From that time on, her studies of voice and composition have never stopped.

During her education at the Novosibirsk Musical College (1986-1990), she participated in various themed-based festivals and competitions, refining her own style as a popular singer on stage.

In December 1990, she went to Japan on a 3-month personal invitation and took part in several festivals in the City of Sapporo, where she represented the Russian culture. At the same time, she signed a contract with the ROAD &amp; SKY Company, and, in May of 1994, she went to Tokyo to record her first album and later continue her career as a singer and composer. ORIGA's contract with ROAD &amp; SKY remained valid until her death.

With her initial musical appearance in the style of Healing Music, ORIGA recorded 4 full albums, 2 mini albums and later a ""Selected Songs"" album through TOSHIBA EMI Records in the period from 1994 through 1999. Her [EIEN ""Eternity""] album was the first Russian language album to appear on the Japanese national hit chart ORICON, and it took the 64th place. The ""Polyushko-Pole"" song from the album was used as a theme song for the famous TBS Channel TV series ""Ao no Jidai"" (Blue Era). During that time, ORIGA took part in various projects with leading Japanese pop artists as a back-vocals producer, worked on advertisements and commercials on radio and television (on the national NHK channel) and performed in music concerts.

After a long maternity leave, in 2003 ORIGA took part in recording several main theme songs for the anime series ""Stand Alone Complex O.S.T"" together with Yoko Kanno, which brought her vast popularity in the world of anime and led to subsequent work in other anime projects. At the same time, she changed her style to Electronica and started to produce her songs independently, releasing, through GEMMATIKA Records, albums ""Era of Queens"" and ""Aurora"", as well as a remake album of her own songs titled ""The Songwreath"".

Since 2008, ORIGA had been invited to participate as a lead singer in the project by a popular Japanese guitarist SUGIZO. Under this project, she had taken part in several concerts and a concert tour abroad.

Prior to her death, ORIGA still performed as a vocalist in a variety of projects. One of them, ""Starry Tales"" for the World Digital Planetariums. This work was in tandem with synthesizer player Himekami and brilliant artist Kagaya. In 2012, she participated in recording three soundtracks for video game ""Final Fantasy XIII-2"".

2478,Shoutarou Ishinomori,1938-01-25 00:00:00+00:00,326,"Died: January 28, 1998 (aged 60)

Shoutarou Ishinomori was an influential figure in manga, anime, and tokusatsu who created several immensely popular long-running series such as Cyborg 009, what would go on to become the Super Sentai series and the Kamen Rider Series. He was twice awarded by the Shogakukan Manga Award, in 1968 for Sabu to Ichi Torimono Hikae and in 1988 for Hotel and Manga Nihon Keizai Nyumon. He was born and named Shoutarou Onodera (小野寺 章太郎) in Tome, Miyagi, and was also known as Shoutarou Ishimori (石森 章太郎) before 1986, when he changed his family name to Ishinomori with ""ノ"".

Cyborg 009, created in 1963, became the first superpowered hero team created in Japan. That same year, Kazumasa Hirai and Jiro Kuwata created Japan's first cyborg superhero, 8 Man (which predated Kamen Rider by eight years). The success of the tokusatsu superhero TV series Kamen Rider, produced by Toei Company Ltd. in 1971, led to the birth of the ""Transforming"" (henshin) superhero (human-sized superheroes who transform by doing a pose, and use martial arts to fight henchmen and the weekly monster), and resulted in many sequel shows to this day. Ishinomori then created many similar superhero dramas, which were once again all produced by Toei or in Sarutobi Ecchan's case Toei Animation, including Android Kikaider , Henshin Ninja Arashi, Inazuman, Robotto Keiji, Secret Task Force Goranger (the first Super Sentai series), Kaiketsu Zubat, Akumaizer 3, Sarutobi Ecchan, the Toei Fushigi Comedy Series and countless others. He even created popular children's shows such as Hoshi no Ko Chobin (Chobin, Child of the Stars, 1974, a co-production with Studio Zero which was a major success on Italian television), and Ganbare!! Robokon.

Ishinomori's art is quite reminiscent of that of his mentor, Osamu Tezuka. The true story of his first meeting with Tezuka was illustrated in a short four-page tale drawn up as supplementary material for the 1970s Astro Boy manga reprints. Around 1955, Ishinomori submitted work to a contest seeking new talent in the magazine, Manga Shonen. Tezuka was impressed by his drawings and asked Ishinomori to help him with Astro Boy. In the American release, this story can be seen in Volume 15, along with Ishinomori's earliest work on the ""Electro"" story arc.

Ishinomori also illustrated a comic adaptation of the Super NES video game The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, which was produced for the American publication Nintendo Power. The comic consisted of 12 chapters, which were serialized from January 1992 (Volume 32) to December 1992 (Volume 43). The comic was republished as a graphic novel collection in 1993.

Ishinomori died of heart failure on January 28, 1998, just 3 days after his 60th birthday. His final work was the tokusatsu superhero TV series, Voicelugger, televised a year later. Two years later, the Kamen Rider Series would be revived with Kamen Rider Kuuga. All of the series made in the Heisei period credit Ishinomori as the creator. The Ishinomori Manga Museum named in his honor opened in Ishinomaki, Miyagi in 2001.[2] Special trains in the Senseki Line were commissioned featuring his artwork generally leading to the museum.

His work posthumously awarded him the Guinness World Record for most comics published by one author, totaling over 128,000 pages.

5099,Akira Kurosawa,1910-03-23 00:00:00+00:00,326,"After training as a painter (he storyboards his films as full-scale paintings), Kurosawa entered the film industry in 1936 as an assistant director, making his directorial debut in 1943. After working in a wide range of genres, he made his breakthrough film Rashômon (1950) in 1950. It won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, and first revealed the richness of Japanese cinema to the West. The next few years saw the low-key, touching Ikiru (1952) (Living), the epic Shichinin no samurai (1954) (Seven Samurai) and the barbaric, riveting Shakespeare adaptation Kumonosu jô (1957) (Throne of Blood), the later two showcasing the magnetic personality of Toshirô Mifune, who also starred in the two samurai comedies Yojimbo (1961) and Tsubaki Sanjûrô (1962). After a lean period in the late 1960s and early 1970s, though, Kurosawa attempted suicide. He survived, and made the Russian co-production Dersu Uzala (1975) and, with the help of admirers Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas, the samurai epic Kagemusha (1980), which was in many ways a dry run for Ran (1985), his second Shakespeare adaptation. He continued to work into his eighties with the more personal Dreams (1990), Hachi-gatsu no kyôshikyoku (1991) and Madadayo (1993). Kurosawa's films have always been more popular in the West than in his native Japan, where critics have viewed his adaptations of Western genres and authors (William Shakespeare, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Maxim Gorky and Evan Hunter) with suspicion—but he's revered by American and European filmmakers, who remade Shichinin no samurai (1954), as The Magnificent Seven (1960), Yojimbo (1961), as Per un pugno di dollari (1964) and Kakushi-toride no san-akunin (1958), as Star Wars (1977).

Kurosawa died on September 6, 1998.

8893,Shinya Ohira,1966-12-12 00:00:00+00:00,284,"Birth place: Aichi Prefecture, Japan

Shinya Ohira is one of the most talented and recognized animator in the world of anime. His animation style includes using exaggerating motion, manipulating gravity and balance with use of different perspective shots, lots of rapid camera movement and unconventional angles. With his boldly distorted and vigorous drawing style, his cuts are unique and instantly recognizable. 

He has worked as an animator for over thirty years. His early work in the 80's mainly consisted of action and effects cuts. He bounced around several studios (including Sunrise, Madhouse, and Pierrot).
His early cuts include Gal Force 2: Destruction (1987), for which he animated a laser beam with a distinctly loose and vivid sense of movement. With its smooth animation and wavy motion pattern, the cut has a lively fluidity to it that can be seen as the first step towards Ohira's current distinctive visuality. He used the same approach on his smoke effects for Akira (1988) and a flood for Angel Cop (1989). His style truly came into fruition when he started applying this to solid objects – especially people. The earliest such case is his cut in episode 10 of The Hakkenden (1994).
Other titles that display his animation skills to fullest are titles like Junkers Come Here (1994), FLCL (2000), ""Kid’s Story"" (2003), Fuujin Monogatari (2003), Mind Game (2004), ""Wanwa the Doggy"" (2008), Redline (2009), Momo e no Tegami (2011), Ping Pong the Animation - OP sequence (2014) and Space Dandy (2014), Night Is Short, Walk on Girl (2017).

Pyotr Ilyich Chaykovsky; 7 May 1840 – 6 November 1893),anglicised as Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky /ˈpiːtər .../, was a Russian composer whose works included symphonies, concertos, operas, ballets, chamber music, and a choral setting of the Russian Orthodox Divine Liturgy. 

Some of these are among the most popular theatrical music in the classical repertoire. He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally, which he bolstered with appearances as a guest conductor later in his career in Europe and the United States. One of these appearances was at the inaugural concert of Carnegie Hall in New York City in 1891.

Tchaikovsky was honored in 1884 by Emperor Alexander III, and awarded a lifetime pension in the late 1880s.

The very first demo-tape she sent to a record company had given her the chance. She was chosen out of 3000 girls, as the heroine of the 2001 fall season drama, “Kizudarake no Love Song (Scarred Love Song)” of the Fuji TV station. In November, she made her sensational debut from Sony Music Associated Records, with the song “STARS”, which was also the theme song of the drama. 

Her second single “CRESCENT MOON”, a groovy track with an 80’s flavor, was the limited product of 100,000 copies only. Amazingly, it sold out the first day of its release. 
In March of 2002 she released her third single “ONE SURVIVE” (which received great feedback) and her first video “FILM LOTUS”, in May her 4th single “HELPLESS RAIN”, in August her 5th single “WILL” was released, tying-up to the sales of over 200,000 and Top Ten hits.

In December of 2006, Mika released “Hitoiro” for the NANA 2 movie under the name “NANA starring MIKA NAKASHIMA,” as well as a NANA album titled “THE END,” marking the conclusion of her association with NANA. 

She did cover version of English songs such as Amazing Grace, The Rose, and What a Wonderful World.

He is also known as the person who thought up the name Game Boy. His ""normal"" activities, however, center around his blog/website, Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun (The Itoi Pretty-Much-Daily News), which publishes Itoi's short essays on lifestyle and spirituality and also his interviews with artists, craftsmen, businessmen, etc., which also tend to center on philosophical issues. Itoi has also co-written several books modeled on these interviews, in which he has a series of long conversations with, for example, an expert on neurology (Kaiba, The Hippocampus), about how to live as a human being in the world.

He has voiced Mei and Satsuki's father, Tatsuo Kusakabe, in the Japanese version of the My Neighbor Totoro anime film, has been a judge on a few episodes of the Japanese shows Iron Chef and Hey! Spring of Trivia, and has also co-authored a collection of short stories titled Yume de aimashou (""Let's meet in a dream"") with writer Haruki Murakami. His latest book, Chiisai Kotoba o Utau Basho (A Place Where Small Words Are Sung), is an anthology of writing collected from the Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun. ""Hobo Nichi"" (as it is called) is currently releasing a series of T-shirts on the theme ""Sentimental Territory"", which feature simple drawings of cute animals with tears in their eyes. It also designs and sells a combination calendar/address book/personal notebook at the beginning of each business year (March-April).

Okazaki made her debut as a singer-songwriter in 1993. During the nineties, she continued singing and also wrote for anime seiyū. From 2000, she became involved in earnest with anime and composed several songs for Wedding Peach, Fruits Basket and Love Hina. She formed the duo Melocure in 2002 with singer-songwriter Megumi Hinata, and in the following two years, the duo released several singles and an album, Melodic Hard Cure. Okazaki also produced songs during these years for artists such as Megumi Hayashibara, Mayumi Iizuka, and Yui Horie.

Her work consists mainly of ballads, and can be categorised within the spectrum of Japanese music as most closely related to J-Pop. According to her fans, the lyrics of Okazaki's songs are characterized by poetic imagery, depth of emotion, gentle optimism and simplicity.

On May 5, 2004, Ritsuko Okazaki died suddenly at the age of 44 from septic shock as a result of septicemia. She was unable to speak any last words, and left her work unfinished.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/23815.jpg

While his works are often described as fantastical, they can hardly be categorized as traditional fantasy stories; instead, Igarashi draws inspiration from folklore and nature combined with surrealism and spiritual themes to create a style that has earned comparisons to the films of Hayao Miyazaki (Igarashi himself stated in an interview that Miyazaki's film My Neighbor Totoro was a key influence on his decision to become a manga artist).  \n

\n
While studying at Atomi University, Okazaki made her debut in Cartoon Burikko, an experimental adult comic anthology primarily aimed at men. Okazaki would then turn her focus to women's issues. Focusing on the issues of contemporary young women, Okazaki never shied away from street culture, high fashion and drug use in her narratives. She would then take on her first a long-running series called Tokyo Girls Bravo; a rare comic to be published in a fashion magazine. Okazaki has been in retirement since the end of the last century as she recovers from a life-threatening traffic accident.\n

Her blood type is B, and she is married to fellow mangaka Tatsuneko. She is a graduate of Mita Senior High School, Tokyo. She currently lives in Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, and also has a daughter.

She began her career as a doujinshi artist creating doujinshi for works such as Saint Seiya, Captain Tsubasa and Maouden.

She debuted in a commercial magazine with the original work Metal Heart (serialised in Kobunsha's Comic VAL from November 1986). After her debut, she continued to contribute on numerous doujin works. However, the later disbanding of a doujin circle, Yajou Teikoku, she had founded with Maki Chikura, led to her taking numerous breaks from her commercial works. Due to this, there were incomplete works penned by her during this period.

During her years in middle school, she had been a fan of Masami Kurumada's manga series Ring ni Kakero, Fuuma no Kojirou, Saint Seiya and B't X (serialised in Weekly Shounen Jump), sending Kurumada numerous fan letters asking to meet him, after which Kurumada finally agreed, inviting her to his workplace.

When asked about her penname in an interview in the September 2006 issue of Puff, she responded that she had originally thought of making it Kouga Jun, but subsequently changed it to Kouga Yun.

Among her noted works is Loveless, which has been serialised in Monthly Comic Zero Sum since 2002 and is ongoing, as well as her work Tenshichou (天使庁). She has also worked as an illustrator on the noted literary magazine Faust.

In 2007, she contributed the character designs to the Sunrise anime series, Mobile Suit Gundam 00.

5970,High and Mighty Color,,169,"High and Mighty Color (ハイ・アンド・マイティ・カラー, Hai ando Maiti Karā) was a Japanese rock band signed to Sony Music Entertainment Japan and formed in 2003.

HIGH and MIGHTY COLOR is made up of six members; Halca (lead vocals), Yusuke (vocals), Kazuto (guitar), MEG (guitar), mACKAz (bass), and SASSY (drums) are its members.
Ex-members: Maakii (lead vocals)
In 2005 the band released their first “Official” single titled “Pride” which was also used as the second opening for the anime Gundam SEED Destiny. Since then the band has been riding a wave of relative success. Its latest release was the 13th single and is a cover of T.M. Revolution's early single, called  ""Hot Limit"". The visual style of both the music video and the promotional images is meant to mimic that of the original. 

On July 1st, 2008, it was announced that Maki was married to DREAMS COME TRUE singer Masato Nakamura on June 22nd, 2008 and would be leaving the band by the end of 2008. In her parting message, Maki thanked her fellow band members and all of their fans for supporting her and the group for such a long time. No plans to add another member have been made yet, but the band is expected to continue on without Maki. A special event was planned for Maki's graduation from the band as well as at least one more single before she leaved the band. 

Later in 2009 after the departure of Maki auditions for a replacement vocalist began, resulting in the new vocalist female singer, Halca.

In 2010 the band was disbanded with the single ""Re:ache"" as their last.

Although many of his earlier works were written and drawn solo, nowadays Ikegami works almost exclusively with collaborators and shows no signs of stopping.\n

He was suspended twice during that time, once for smoking and once for cheating on a test. Atushi was also a member of a band before becoming interested in comedy. For his first comic act, Atsushi teamed up with a classmate from school. They called themselves Umaseki Fugutarou and Fugunosuke, a name they derived from Shimonoseki, and fugu or pufferfish, a dish famous in the region. Atsushi eventually teamed up with Ryo Tamura after relocating to Tokyo. They chose to go by “London Boots” initially because it was the name of a fictional comedy team who themselves took it after some high-heeled shoes. While “London Boots” does not have any particular meaning in English, in Japanese it refers to the knee length platform shoes worn by some Japanese girls.

3606,Yoshihiro Tatsumi,1935-06-13 00:00:00+00:00,146,"Died: March 7, 2015 (aged 79)\n
\n
Birth place: Osaka, Osaka Prefecture, Japan\n
\n
In the late 1950s, Yoshihiro Tatsumi began using the visual language of manga to tell gritty, literary stories about the private lives of everyday people. He has been called ""the grandfather of Japanese alternative comics."" Recently, his works have been seeing a resurgence of popularity, and he has been published in many languages.\n
\n
Tatsumi is widely credited with starting the gekiga (劇画, ""dramatic pictures"") style of alternative comics in Japan, having allegedly coined the term in 1957. He has thus influenced comic artists around the world.\n
 \n
Gekiga is a more serious and realistic style than that of manga, which at the time was aimed toward children. The mainstream publications out of Tokyo produced the manga style, but the main support for the gekiga alternative comic style were the lending libraries out of Osaka. Over time, those who grew up reading manga wanted something more adult, and gekiga filled that need.\n
\n
The 1960s generation of Japanese youth became known as the Manga Generation; it was a sign of rebellion, and gekiga comics were central to that, including political movements espoused by the young. Eventually, the style had grown in popularity to the point that it influenced people like Osamu Tezuka (who was iconic of the mainstream manga style). This acceptance of varied styles in manga engendered the period called The Golden Age of Manga, which extended from the 1970s into the 1980s. Today, with the development of new schools of alternative comics in Japan, the influence of gekiga is declining, but it still appears, mostly in seinen comics.\n

Zodiac: Aries
Blood Type: A

Real Name: Maki Satoh

Her nom du plume has also been spelled as Est Em by Deux Press and her real name is Maki Satoh. The author's preferred romanization of her penname is not capitalized (est em) and is derived from 'esu to emu' (S and M).

She debuted with three yaoi collections after being scouted in art school. She was a student of Rachel Thorn, who provided translations for some of the English licenses of her work. Her work has been praised as having unusual maturity and depth, both for yaoi and for manga in general. 

Her works tend to have a strong common theme connecting the stories in each of her collections. Seduce Me After the Show centers on the artistic worlds of dance, art and music, while Red Blinds the Foolish contains five short stories that are either set in Spain or have Spanish characters.

Another common trait is that her stories tend to depict sets of strong dichotomies between contrasting themes, ideals, cultures, artistic styles, and personalities that are all embedded in the intense and passionate relationships between her characters and in her artwork, which is distinctive as it makes use of simple lines and negative space.

They formed in Kobe in 2009, and after playing together for about a year they were chosen to play on the extremely selective ""Rookie a Go-Go"" stage at Japan's mammoth Fuji Rock festival. Their performance there caught the ears of Japan's rock fans, but what really brought them to prominence was a landmark gig at a secret party held by the fashion brand Hysteric Glamour last November. After that night, they became the talk of Japan's fashion cognoscenti.

In March of 2011, they started selling their first self-recorded CD-Rs at live shows. Those discs, ""The Mad Princess"" and ""The Wrath of the Royal Family,"" quickly sold out, and allowed the band's label Ziyoou Records to release their next recording ""Witch Hunt"" nationwide. And now they'll put out their major-label debut on Sony Music Associated Records in Fall 2011.The night she announced their decision to sign with a major, bandleader Avu-chan decided to share the band's reasoning, which was basically that they'd ""get to wear way more awesome clothes"" and ""push to even further levels of excess."" That should give listeners some clue as to what sort of debut to anticipate.

Maki Murakami made her manga debut in the 1995 April issue of Kimi to Boku. Her work was entitled ""Narcissist no Higeki"", roughly translated as ""The Tragedy of a Narcissist"".

After a year, Maki Murakami began to publish a series, Gravitation, in Kimi to Boku. The manga was really loved by the public, but it abruptly ended with the closing of the magazine in 2000. By great demand from the fans, the manga was published solo, and in 2002 Gentosha picked it up.  A sequel to the original 12-volume story began publishing in 2007 in webcomic form in the online magazine Genzo (Gentosha), and is called Gravitation EX.

Gravitation brought her her widest audience. Aside from the Gravitation manga, Maki Murakami is also the artist for all of the Gravitation Remixes, a doujinshi series that follows the ""further"" relationship between Yuki and Shuichi.  
Her doujinshi circle publishes various doujin especially for her series Gravitation. Gravitation was so successful it has its own anime series, which consists of 13 episodes (2001), and an OVA (1999).

Yoshinaga debuted in 1994 with The Moon and the Sandals, serialized in Hanaoto magazine, but was previously a participant in comic markets. Of Yoshinaga's many works, several have been licensed internationally. She was also selected and exhibited as one of the ""Twenty Major Mangaka Who Contributed to the World of Shojo Manga (World War II to Present)"" for Professor Masami Toku's exhibition, ""Shojo Manga: Girl Power!"" at CSU-Chico. Outside of her work with Japanese publishers, she also self-publishes original doujinshi on a regular basis, most notably for Antique Bakery. Yoshinaga has also drawn fan parodies of Slam Dunk, Rose of Versailles, and Legend of Galactic Heroes. Although little is known about Yoshinaga's personal life, she mentions that her favorite operas are those by Mozart in the author's note to Solfege. In an interview, she has said that ""I want to show the people who didn't win, whose dreams didn't come true. It is not possible for everybody to get first prize. I want my readers to understand the happiness that people can get from trying hard, going through the process, and getting frustrated.""

His rhyming style makes use of lyrics which are largely conceptual in nature and his hip-hop sound is known for blending various influences, ranging from reggae to traditional Japanese music to jazz. The style of music has made him a significant presence within the underground rap community, and he has achieved recognition beyond the scene for rapping ""Battlecry"", the theme song of the hip-hop-influenced chanbara anime Samurai Champloo, produced by Japanese jazz rap DJ Nujabes.

Ichirou Itano is a Japanese anime artist, director, and producer. He has worked in a number of science fiction anime series, especially mecha-themed ones.

Itano is best known among anime fans for a style of action scene that he developed, usually nicknamed ""Itano circus"" or ""Macross missile massacre"" by fans; it refers to a highly stylized and acrobatic method of depicting aerial combat and dogfights in many anime, particularly the Macross series.

The Itano Circus is characterized by detailed, fluid shading of the mecha, the close-range acrobatic moves the duelling fighters make in combat, as well as twisting contrails left by fighters and missiles. It is also commonly used in specific reference to an attack where a mecha or spaceship launches a large swarm of missiles with meticulously animated spiraling smoke trails and erratic trajectories.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/43121.jpg

His breakthrough as animator was Satelight's sci-fi series Noein: Mou Hitori no Kimi e, where he together with Matsumoto did some remarkable work, in particular the 12th episode was highly regarded by animation fans and other animators for the given display by the two.

ryo-timo's dedication for animation could be also seen in the Mainichi and TAF award winner film Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo, where he did a minute long shot of the main character, Makoto, running, for which he actually went to the real world street that Makoto is running down in Tokyo, then filmed himself running it.

2010,Nobuteru Yuuki,1962-12-24 00:00:00+00:00,75,"Nobuteru's history as an artist started in a rather humble way. Before his career in animation ever took off, he was working in a simple government job, and was no more than a fan of anime himself. While attending an anime convention, Nobuteru had the chance to speak with an animator who encouraged him to pursue the field of work, and he decided from that point that he too would be an animator. Nobuteru's first projects would be doujinshi, self-published manga of an amateur level, which he worked on under the pen name The Man In The High Castle. During this time he says he looked to other anime and manga as influence for his work. With his style established and a small name made for himself, he was finally able to secure a position as a part-time animator at Studio Min and DAST, where he worked on Megazone 23. With his foot in the animation industry door, Nobuteru's career grew quickly, with character design role being handed to him in 1989 for the anime movie Five Star Stories. His industry options expanded further to include commissions for video game conceptual design, with 1995 marking his first role as character designer for the Japan-only release of Seiken Densetsu 3 (equivalently: Secret of Mana 2). Gamers probably know him best for the vast number of character designs he provided for Chrono Cross several years later, as well as following titles in the Mana series.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/38393.jpg

After spending her childhood in Tokushima and Okayama, Angela moved from Japan to Hawaii at age 15, continuing on to study Political Science at George Washington University in Washington D.C.
 
Angela's music started to materialize as a career while she was still in university.  In 2003, Angela Aki returned to Japan, and the 2005 release of her single ""HOME"" marked her major label debut.  Her first album ""HOME"" has become a classic since its release in 2006, with cumulative sales counting over 600,000 units.  Angela and Nobuo Uematsu, the composer renowned for the music in the Final Fantasy game series, co-wrote the single ""Kiss Me Good-Bye"" for the international megahit game Final Fantasy XII on PlayStation 2. 

Within the year of her debut album, Angela successfully made her dream of playing at The Budokan a reality in December 2006.

Ironically, only one member has so far been touched by the great eraser in the sky; Yuritan herself! Now, an even more mysterious figure is running things, going by the name of Chiitan. Mind you, I call into the question the validity the band’s extensive 12-member line-up, as well as if Yuritan, Chiitan and the rest of them are real people or the imagination of one or a few. A talking black cat by the name of Kuroneko is their chief publicity officer.

male singer and actor from Japan. His songs were made into theme songs for the hit anime Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle (""It's"", ""blaze"", ""aerial"") and Gravitation. He is best known for his musical contributions to Gravitation.

In Gravitation, Kotani was the singing voice for the lead singer of 'Bad Luck', Shuichi Shindou. Commonly mistaken as the seiyuu, he is the voice behind all the songs that Shindou sings, such as 'Rage Beat', 'Blind Game Again', 'Smashing Blue', and many others. Another misconception is that songs not intended for the Gravitation series are considered 'Gravitation songs'.

Kinya was previously in a band called Mad Soldiers. They released a mini-album called Mads Laboratory before Kinya released his solo singles. Mad Soldiers is also the backing band that performs the music in his songs, and they have also played at Kinya's concerts.

570,Frank Welker,1946-03-12 00:00:00+00:00,63,"Franklin W. Welker (born March 12, 1946) is an American voice actor. He is responsible for a broad spectrum of character voices, noises, and other vocal effects that have appeared over the last 40 years in American television and motion pictures. He is listed as the number one ""All Time Top 100 Stars at the Box office"" in terms of the total revenue his films have generated. His work in over 90 films has put him ahead of Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks and Samuel L. Jackson.\n
\n
n the 1980s, Welker voiced Megatron, Soundwave and his cassettes, the Dinobot Sludge, and Galvatron in place of Leonard Nimoy (Season 3) in the Transformers cartoon. In this he formed a team with Chris Latta, who voiced Starscream, Megatron's second-in-command. In 1988, Welker did the voice of Rulon leader Krulos in the TV-series Dino-riders. In this cartoon he again formed a team with Chris Latta, who (coincidentally?) voiced Rasp, Krulos' second-in-command. In G.I. Joe, Welker also teamed with Latta. (Other actors who featured in Transformers, Dino-riders and G.I. Joe are Jack Angel, Charlie Adler and Peter Cullen.) In a famous goof from Transformers, Soundwave's unmodulated voice was revealed to be nearly identical to that of Dr. Claw of Inspector Gadget",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/39683.jpg

Paul is frequently cast in one of two roles: a brilliantly cunning, evil villain, or a thuggish strong guy. He also plays characters that provide some sense of comic relief, usually a minion of some kind of relatively small size.\n
\n
Arguably, Paul's most notable role as a villainous character would be Naraku from InuYasha, with the manipulative Sideways from Transformers: Armada and the vicious dark-hunter Nidhiki from Bionicle 2: Legends of Metru Nui as close seconds. As the tough guy, he is recognized as the elder Enzo Matrix from ReBoot, and the unstoppable Juggernaut from X-Men Evolution. His prominent comedic roles are Myoga from InuYasha, and Howdy from Hamtaro, as well as Happosai from Ranma ½. He commonly acts alongside his brothers, such as during the hit Bionicle movies B2 and B3, in which he also played Toa Whenua (a strong-guy character), as well as during Ranma 1/2 and Hamtaro. He had voice Doctor Doom in the Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes animated series.\n
\n
Some of his video game roles, he can be heard as Sgt. Dwight Boykin in Dead Rising 2. Sometime in 2011 with the release of Marvel vs Capcom 3 & Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3, he reprise his role as Doctor Doom, as well as voicing Shuma-Gorath.\n

Since then his career has expanded in the direction of composing and producing, including writing songs for pop artists such as Hikaru Nishida and Kahoru Kohiruimaki. But as his creative interests began to diversify, he started focusing more on soundtrack composition for TV, anime, games and motion pictures. His dual experience in both pop and soundtrack production makes him one of the very few individuals capable of producing high quality material in either field. Noriyuki's musical savvy is featured in the soundtrack for the popular animation series ""Rurouni Kenshin"" (1995), and the international success of PlayStation game ""Tenchu""(1998) gave people all around the world a chance to experience his unique Pan-Asian sound. Currently he has just finished working on the soundtrack for ""Tenchu 2"", and is looking for opportunities in Hollywood in which his musical style - which fuses elements from throughout Asia, spanning from the Middle East and Western Asia to traditional Chinese and Japanese - can be used as a vehicle to move and excite the listener in a way that only he can do.

At first, she wasn't even interested in singing—she was more into dancing, actually—but her desire to become a singer began when a friend encouraged her to join a karaoke singing event in 2003. During her second year in junior-high school, in the middle of the summer of 2003, Hitomi applied for the Sony Music Auditions. Because of a change in interest, Hitomi moved from singing dance musicto singing rock music.

In 2004, Hitomi was selected as the finalist for the Sony Music SD audition (Vo-che3); 20,000 others had auditioned. She had been worried that because of her height (147 cm), she would be overlooked, but her powerful voice attracted the attention of people while she sang live. The end of 2004 found her being chosen to sing the theme song for ""GUNDAM SEED DESTINY."" Recording of her song ""Bokutachi no Yukue"" began at the end of the year.

...Okay - so little about myself:  ....what inspired me to become a manga artist?  Well, manga is my passion!  Manga is my life!  I loved drawing and I loved reading manga as long as I can remember.  I’ve always carried pencils and papers everywhere I went.  I always knew that I wanted to become a manga artist....  

When I’m not working, I like to decompress and relax with my favorite movies:  SEX and the CITY, The Phantom of the Opera, Great Detectives Poirot… well, don’t get me started with my favorite movies list… cuz I have tons more and I can’t choose!   My taste buds are keen on soba, sushi and Chinese food!  *awh… drool*  I’m also a wine, tea and coffee connoisseur!  My current obsession includes: aromatherapy -- highly recommended! very therapeutic!  Cosmology - okay I admit, I don't know much about it but it sounds interesting and I want to learn more!  ...and of course, SEX and the CITY! -- love this movie!  I'm hoping my next vacation destination will be Manhattan New York!  I’m dying to check out all the hot spots and all the buzz from the movie!....

\n
Nakazawa was born March 14, 1939 in Hiroshima, Japan. At the age of 6, he survived the 1945 Hiroshima bombing and the loss of most of his immediate family — his father, older sister, younger brother, and younger sister. Only he, his mother, and two brothers who were not at home survived.\n
\n
After graduating from middle school in 1954, he moved to Tokyo in 1961 and became a published manga creator at the age of 24 in 1963. He created several titles such as Kuroi Ame ni Utarete (Drenched by Black Rain) after the passing of his mother in 1966, before drawing his most famous work from 1973 to 1985. The resulting ten volumes of Barefoot Gen have since sold over 6.5 millon copies and have been translated in over 10 languages, including English, Russian, and Korean.\n
\n
Nakazawa had undergone treatment for lung cancer and related ailments in 2010 and 2011. He had abandoned plans for a new Barefoot Gen sequel in 2009 due to his worsening eyesight from a cataract and a damaged retina. However, he said, ""Our generation must continue to tell of the horrors of atomic bombs and war.""\n
\n
Nakazawa passed away on December 19, 2012 at a Hiroshima hospital due to lung cancer. He was 73. \n

In 1987, he moved with his family to South Plainfield, New Jersey, where Gomez attended school. Upon graduation from South Plainfield High School, Gomez moved to New York City to pursue acting.\n
\n
Following a small role in feature film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, he landed the recurring role of ""Endless Mike"", a quietly crazed, melodramatic high school student in the surreal children's series The Adventures of Pete and Pete, filmed in New Jersey. His highly original performance was singled out for praise by series creators Will McRobb and Chris Viscardi on the series' DVD audio commentary.\n
\n
Gomez went on to appear in small roles in many TV series, telefilms and feature films. (See Filmography, below). Additionally, he co-wrote, with director Damon Santostefano, and starred in the documentary-like feature — or possibly dramatized documentary — Last Man Running (unreleased; made 2003), which also starred wife Jenifer Wymore-Gomez, brother Joshua Gomez, and other New York City film professionals as themselves; it was screened at the Phoenix Film Festival and possibly elsewhere. Gomez was previously executive producer of A Waiter Tomorrow (1998), directed and co-written by Korean-American filmmaker Michael Kang (who appears as himself in Last Man Running).\n
\n
Gomez is also an established voice actor whose credits include the video game Call of Duty 2: Big Red One, the character Gippal in the English dub of Final Fantasy X-2, the character of Zack in Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII and a minor role as the voice of a pilot in The Animatrix. He recently had a cameo in Transformers, playing a Sheriff who attempts to apprehend the protagonist. He and his wife have two sons.\n

Japanese actor, dancer and singer. He is best known for his role as Shusuke Fuji in The Prince of Tennis musical series, Tenimyu, and the live film adaptation. Aiba was a former member of the disbanded three-men streetdancing group called Brights. The other two members included Atsushi Koga and Takuya, who would also happened to later play Akutagawa Jirou in Tenimyu with Aiba. The group had to break up because Aiba had to join Avex (his previous agency) after he won in the Junon Boy contest. There were originally 4 people in the group, but one dropped out, so that left Aiba, Takuya, and Atsushi, in Brights. At that time, Aiba was still an amateur at dancing and he's stated in past blog entries that he owes a lot to Takuya, who was already an experienced dancer by then, for teaching him various things.

He is now member of ""top coat"" agency.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/17353.jpg

HJO 
Height
5' 6"" (1.68 m)

American child actor who at this writing (2000) has proven himself perhaps the best young actor of his generation. The son of actor Eugene Osment and teacher Theresa Osment, Haley was chosen for a commercial at age four after a casting director spotted him in a furniture store with his parents. Within months, he had landed a small but memorable role as Tom Hanks's son in Forrest Gump (1994) and a starring role as Edward Asner's grandson on the TV series ""Thunder Alley"" (1994). His comedy skills were manifest very young, and he followed ""Thunder Alley"" (1994) with two more sitcoms. Norman Jewison gave him his first leading role on the big screen in Bogus (1996), and he proved completely at ease in this dramatic role. However, it took the smash hit The Sixth Sense (1999) to brand the young actor on the public consciousness. His devastating performance as the haunted Cole Sear brought him an Oscar nomination at age 11 and a memorable tribute at the awards from winner Michael Caine: ""Once I learned of your nomination and saw your performance, I knew for sure you would win."" Since then, Osment has given an equally powerful performance in Pay It Forward (2000). Along with bravura performances, he has developed an equal reputation in the industry for unspoiled professionalism. His younger sister, Emily Osment, has made several impressive film and television appearances as well.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/3/1720.jpg

Akina became interested in anime at the age of 9 when she watched Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan with her brother. She entered the 4th Anisong Grand Prix under the name Chuna Cho (趙 秋奈) as a 14-year-old and became a finalist after winning the Sendai qualification tournament. However, she was eliminated in the first round of the Tokyo finals.

The following year, she enrolled in the Akihabara IT campus of Clark Memorial International High School. She participated in a seiyuu audition for the Xbox 360 game Meikyuu Cross Blood Reloaded, winning the role of Hikaru Nanase. In another audition in 2012, she was accepted into the Sun Music Production talent agency under the name Chuna. She made her anime debut later that year in Binbougami ga! as a regular extra voice.

In June 2013, Chuna formed the vocal unit Princess Kettsu with fellow seiyuu Mariko Nakatsu and Mako Morino. The group disbanded in July 2014. Chuna left Sun Music Production to become a freelancer in March 2015.

Upon joining Stardust Promotion in January 2016, she stopped going by her stage name, Chuna, and started using her real name, Akina.

Died: February 28, 2003

Agency: Tokyo Haiyu Seikatsu Kyodo Kumiai (Haikyo Tokyo Actor Livelihood Cooperative Association) - 1997

Ms You Inoue passed away February 28, 2003, 9:29 a.m. Ms Inoue's physical condition deteriorated due to cancer in the winter of 2001. She had an operation sometime in 2002 and was rehospitalized in December 2002. Her condition changed suddenly during the latter part of February 2003 and she died February 28 of cancer (lung edema) aged 56 years. A private funeral with family and close friends only was held in Tokyo on March 6. We pray for her happiness in the next world...

Ms Inoue was a seiyuu whose voice talents spanned a considerable range. Consider Ran of Urusei Yatsura, which required Ms Inoue to provide a soft, cutesy voice when Ran was being coy, and moments later build up to a powerful, angry voice with an edge to it. Ms Inoue could also perform the serious, mature voice of Kanuka of Patlabor, and give an edge of excitement at the right moment for comedic or dramatic effect. The ultimate example of Ms Inoue's talents is Yuzuha in the second Tenchi Muyo movie. Yuzuha is a very emotional character and provided quite an opportunity for Ms Inoue to demonstrate her voice acting ability.

Chitose Hajime was recognized as a gifted folk singer at a young age. She won many folk song competitions, released two traditional folk albums on an indie label, and was approached by numerous record labels. She decided to study to become a beautician instead of pursuing music. However, Hajime had severe allergic reactions to many of the chemicals used by beauticians. She withdrew from school, and seriously considered a music career.

In 2001, she released a self titled mini-album on the indie label Office Augusta. The album was covers of older songs, but was so well received that Hajime was pushed to release another mini-album. In August 2001, Chitose released her second mini-album with Augusta Records entitled Kotonoha (コトノハ). This release featured 5 original tracks.

In 2002, she released her first major label single on Epic Records - ""Wadatsumi no Ki"" (ワダツミの木). It was the third highest selling single of the year behind only Hikaru Utada's ""traveling"", and Ayumi Hamasaki's ""H"". Three months later, she released a brand new single, ""Kimi wo Omō"" (君ヲ想フ?). While also very popular, it was not nearly the success that her first single was, although it did help to cement her as a permanent artist.

Her first major album, Hainumikaze (ハイヌミカゼ), followed later in the year. It sold 800,000 copies, charted for 57 weeks, and was the 16th highest selling album of the year.

She released 3 more singles before her second major album, Nomad Soul (ノマド・ソウル), was released in 2003. Shortly after a concert tour, and the release of a live album and DVD in 2004, Hajime announced that she would be taking time away from the music scene to get married, and have a child. Her first child miscarried, but she successfully gave birth to a girl on January 20, 2005.

She returned to the music industry in November 2005 with the single ""Kataritsugu Koto"" (語り継ぐこと), the ending theme for the anime BLOOD+. The single was a hit, reaching #12 on the Oricon charts. She followed this success with her next come-back single, ""Haru no Katami"" (春のかたみ), the ending theme for the anime AYAKASHI - Japanese Classic Horror. This single sold 6050 copies in its first week, and remained on the charts for 7 weeks total. A third single was released before her next album. The single, ""Ao no Requiem"" (青のレクイエム), was the theme song for the Studio GAGA film Hatsukoi. It featured 1 extra track, and charted for 3 weeks. The following week, Hajime released her third original major album, Hanadairo (ハナダイロ). The album was available in both a regular edition, and a limited edition. The limited edition featured a 13th track, ""Shinda Onna no Ko"" (死んだ女の子) with Ryuichi Sakamoto), as well as a DVD containing the music videos for ""Kataritsugu Koto"", and ""Haru no Katami"".

Studies have revealed that her particular style of singing, including aspects of traditional Amami-Ōshima music, has a relaxing effect that has been observed in electroencephalograms taken from the brains of people listening to her singing.

9204,Janne Da Arc,1996-05-09 00:00:00+00:00,21,"Janne Da Arc (ジャンヌダルク) is currently signed on the motorod record label, a subsidiary of avex trax. They have released three indies albums, nine major-label albums (including single collections), 26 singles, and 14 DVDs.

On May 9, 2006, they celebrated their tenth anniversary of their formation, the date marking when the final member, shuji, became an official fixture of the band's lineup. The band was not named after historical figure Joan of Arc, despite their song ""Kyuuseishu --Messiah--"" being about her; rather, yasu named the band after a character in the manga ""Devilman"" by Go Nagai. A picture series of the character can be seen on the art for the band's limited edition Janne Da Arc 10th ANNIVERSARY INDIES COMPLETE BOX, released March 15, 2006.

Their sound is self-described as ""pop-rock"", and vocalist yasu takes many musical cues from his musical idol, MORRIE of the 1980s rock band DEAD END. However, Janne Da Arc has proven themselves to be very versatile as well as proficient at their chosen instruments, and draws influence from the favorite bands and musical styles of all of their members.

As of January 26 2007, the members of Janne Da Arc are pursuing solo projects, concurrent with their work in the band. See official announcement in Japanese or an unofficial fan translation into English, and below for an itemization of solo activities by member.

On May 19, 2009, they released their major debut 10th anniversary COMPLETE BOX which topped the Oricon chart.

Inoue Makio was born November 30, 1940 in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan. He was a veteran voice actor (seiyuu) affiliated with Aoni Production.

Inoue died on November 29, 2019 due to worsening angina. He was 80 years old.

He began voice acting in the '60s, landing small roles in Astroboy, and was the actor of choice for deep-voiced, serious males in the '70s. Toward the end of his career, Inoue rarely took on new roles (but he did have a cameo in Samurai Champloo, playing Mariya Enshirou in episodes 24–26). He was most noted for his two longstanding roles as the title character in Captain Harlock from 1978 though the '80s and '90s (Yamadera Kouichi of Cowboy Bebop fame took over this role in 1998), and Ishikawa Goemon XIII of Lupin III from 1977 through his death (taking over from Ootsuka Chikao, who played the role in '71 and '72).

Ai Kago is a J-pop singer, actress, author and Guinness Book of World Records breaking hula hoop player.

At age 12, Kago won the 4th National Audition of Morning Musume held by Up-Front Works Agency in 2000, which led to her admission into the extremely popular girl band as a 4th generation member. In the same year, she became a founding member of Mini Moni. In 2004, she graduated from both the aforementioned groups and formed W with Nozomi Tsuji.

In 2006, photos of the under-age Kago Ai smoking were leaked by the media. As a result, she was immediately suspended for one year by Up-Front Works Agency. In 2007, toward the end of her suspension, she was caught once again smoking and was found to be romantically involved with a 37-year-old man. This resulted in her contract being terminated permanently. After a hiatus that lasted a year, she signed a contract with R&amp;A Promotions Co.,Ltd and resumed her career as an actress and a singer.

Rebecca Lynn Olkowski is an american voice actress.

After studying theater at Orange Coast College, in Costa Mesa, California, Forstadt began her acting career by working at Knott's Berry Farm's Bird Cage Theater, performing melodramas, often as the damsel in distress character. Later, she went to Hollywood where she worked as a wardrobe mistress on such television shows as The White Shadow and Hill Street Blues, as well as for the film S.O.B.. She also spent several years doing live theater in the Los Angeles area. Most notably, she won some recognition for her portrayal of the character Josette in the world premiere of Eugène Ionesco's Tales for People Under 3 Years of Age at the Stages Theatre Center in 1982. She starred in several low-budget movies such as Mugsy's Girls, with Ruth Gordon and Laura Branigan, and Round Numbers with Kate Mulgrew, Samantha Eggar, and Shani Wallis. She also appeared as a television actress in Hill Street Blues, St. Elsewhere, and L.A. Law. Her voice acting breakthrough came when she landed the leading role of Lynn Minmei in the English version of Robotech, the popular anime series of the 1980s. Since then, she has voiced hundreds of other anime characters and has branched into non-anime cartoons, live-action shows (such as Masked Rider and Power Rangers: Time Force), commercials and radio work, and has performed background voices for movies such as Antz, Dr. Dolittle, and The Santa Clause.

Koide Mieko has a somewhat bipolar approach to storytelling. Her works cover the range from a sweet love story involving a haunted apartment to darker stories of love within obsession. From the beginning of one of her manga, it is often difficult to discern what type of series it will be, as she keeps many secrets as her tale unfolds. Her stories are generally set in everyday life with ordinary people, although occasionally she throws in a bit of the supernatural to keep you off balance. Her works involve exclusively homosexual male pairings, handled with a realism that the genre rarely sees. (from Senshi Gakuen)",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/1/1904.jpg

He makes hentai manga. But not ""just"" the kind of hentai manga that features as much overt sex as possible and little realistic storyline. Tamaoki's stories display a great sense of psychological detail, and usually end in a refreshing way. He says about his work: ""I want to create hentai manga that convey a feeling of everyday life."" His first collection was Eroi Hon (Erotic-ish Book) in 1995. His manga has been published in many magazines, and also been published in the USA. One of his best known manga is Blood: the Last Vampire.\n

Occupation: Actress, voice performer

Known for tough-chick roles, Michelle Rodriguez is proof that there is a cross between beauty and brawn. Born in Bexar County, Texas on July 12, 1978, Michelle always knew she was destined to become a star, she just didn't know how to get there. Michelle lived in Texas until the age of 8 when her family moved to the Dominican Republic where she lived for two years before moving to Puerto Rico. At 11, Michelle's family relocated for the last time to Jersey City, New Jersey. Although she has been working since 1999 as an extra in such films as Summer of Sam (1999) and Cradle Will Rock (1999), it only took a magazine ad announcing an open casting call in New York for Michelle to decide to finally step into the spotlight. The role was the female lead, the movie was Girlfight (2000). Despite the lack of experience in film and boxing, Michelle auditioned, along with another 350 girls. After various trials inside an actual boxing ring and five arduous months of training in Brooklyn's Gleason's Gym, she was finally chosen to portray the role of Diana Guzman. As soon as the independent film began making the rounds at various film festivals, Michelle began gaining critical acclaim for her performance earning her awards like the Deaxville Festival of American Cinema award for Best Actress and the Las Vegas Film Critics Society for Female Breakthrough Performance. As Girlfight (2000) continued to gain notoriety with its September 2000 release, Michelle was already hard at work with films like 3 A.M. (2001), the blockbuster hit The Fast and the Furious (2001), and Resident Evil (2002). With Hollywood calling her name, the future for this feisty Jersey girl is as strong as the punches she throws.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/1656.jpg

The stories by ""Doctor Heaven"" mainly cover the fantasy, mystic or parapsychologic genre—but the main part is still yaoi. The mangaka also likes to draw a lot of shota manga of the hard kind. The drawings are very straight with few use of textures which makes the artworks to real graphic masterpieces. All who love fantasy and wicked character should read Dr. Ten's stories. Many of her works were released in popular hard-yaoi anthologies like ""Stinger,"" ""Junichi Real"" and the shota magazine ""X-Kids."" There are also some doujinshi to series like ""Prince of Tennis,"" ""Trigun,"" ... and originals, also hentai (lolicon). The character-design of the boyslove game ""Gakuen Prince"" was also Dr. Ten's creation.

http://ameblo.jp/mari-yaguchi/
Fanclub:
http://www.up-fc.jp/m-line/member/yaguchi_mari/

Non-anime roles:
Doris in ""Isle of Lesbos"" (movie; Japanese dub)
Tomoko in ""Pinch Runner"" (movie) (Japanese)
Yaguchi-san in ""Mini-Moni the Movie: Okashi na Daibouken"" (movie) (Japanese)
Yurika in ""Gal Circle"" (drama) (Japanese)

Mari Yaguchi became a member of Morning Musume during the second generation auditions, but resigned suddenly in April 2005. She basically cited her desire to move on ""as an adult"" with her career. The underlying reason that she had to quit was because it was discovered by the tabloid magazine FRIDAY that she was in a relationship with actor Shun Oguri though she was 22 at the time. Yaguchi and Oguri have reportedly broken up since April of 2006. Yaguchi's TV show Yaguchi Hitori (やぐちひとり?) continues as before, and she now focuses on Japanese variety shows as guests and hosts rather than ventures on a singing career.
Early on in the group Yaguchi was often perceived as being ""the short one"" as she did not stand out a lot, but by the time 4th generation joined she had become one of the most active members of the group. Her most famous phrase is ""Sexy Beam!"" one of her solo lines from Morning Musume's ""Koi no Dance Site"" single, and she was asked jokingly in Joshi Kashimashi Monogatari, ""When will your real sexy beam come out?"". The ""Sexy beam!"" line has made its way around fans and fellow musicians alike. When she graduated from Morning Musume she was the last person to join before the year 2000 (Kaori Iida had left nearly 2 months before), and she currently has the fifth longest tenure of any member, with only Takahashi Ai, Niigaki Risa, Hitomi Yoshizawa and Kaori Iida being in the group longer.
Her first post-Morning Musume recording, ""Nigiyaka na Fuyu"", done as a collaboration with Berryz Kobo, appears as the coupling track on Berryz Kobo's November 2005 single ""Gag 100 Kaibun Aishite Kudasai"".
Yaguchi was the drama queen in a Japanese drama series called Sento no Musume (銭湯の娘!? daughter of public bathhouse?), Yaguchi was one of the main stars in a Japanese day time drama series called Gyarusa (ギャルサ Gal Circle?), along with her show Yaguchi Hitori, and MCing Hello! Project concerts. From May 25, 2007 and up to June 6, 2007, Yaguchi performed in ""Damn Yankees"", a popular 1955 Broadway musical at the Tokyo Aoyama Theater.[1]
In summer of 2007, Yaguchi was recruited to host a new Gyao TV show, ""Midtown TV"", becoming her third television show on air. ""Midtown TV"" airs all weekdays and Yaguchi hosts it on Thursdays. Also, Mari and seven H!P Eggs are scheduled to appear live and with audience on ""Ciao TV"", a Kids Station show, on 09/02, 19h~19.30h, on what appears to be yet another TV show. With that commencing, Yaguchi will be in four TV shows being aired simultaneously.[2]
It was announced October 19, 2008, on the official Hello! Project website, that Yaguchi, together with the entire Hello! Project Elder Club, will graduate March 31, 2009.[3] A graduation concert was held at Yokohama Arena on February 1, 2009.[4]
Following the popularity of singles and an album released in conjunction with the Japanese variety program, Quiz! Hexagon II (クイズ!ヘキサゴンII?), Yaguchi released her debut single, ""Seishun Boku/Seishun Ore"" (青春 僕/青春 俺?), four years after her final release in Morning Musume. She performed the song for the first time on Quiz! Hexagon II on February 25, 2009.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/7221.jpg

So far, he has released three singles and most recently a mini-album. His first single ""Baby It's You"" was used as the ninth ending theme for the anime Bleach. His second single ""Pride of Tomorrow"" was the second ending theme for the anime D.Gray-man.

June first began singing in his second year of intermediate school. After his friends told him he was not good at singing, he practiced for two years until, finally, during his first year of high school, he was able to move his friends to tears with his singing.

At the age of 17, June recorded a cover of Musiq's ""Love."" This song reached Matsuo ""KC"" Kiyoshi, a well-known R&amp;B producer, who then flew to Korea to meet June.

When he started at the company in 1989, he began with an anthology of various shorts and one-shots collectively known as Shiina Department Store. Eventually one of these one-shots, about a beautiful, money grubbing female exorcist and her lecherous companion, would become the basis of his most well know work: Ghost Sweeper Mikami: Gokuraku Daisakusen!! (more well known by its shorter name: Ghost Sweeper Mikami, or GS Mikami) Running from 1991 through 1999, it became well known and popular work in Sunday, even leading to an anime of the series from 1993 through 1994 by Toei Animation as well as a Shogakukan Manga Award for shounen in 1993. Even as he had success with Mikami, Shiina continued to create various one-shot stories on the side of his main series.\n
\n
After the end of GS Mikami, Shiina tried to create new series for the manga anthology, such as Ichiban-yu no Kanata and Mister Japan. He also created new series and shorts on the side, including GS Holmes: Gokuraku Daisakusen!! (an alternate take on Sherlock Holmes co-starring the robotic Maria from GS Mikami) In 2003, Shiina introduced another of his many ideas in Shounen Sunday in short form: Zettai Karen Children, about three young girls with great psychic powers and terrifying ambitions. Finding some success with it in short form, the mangaka introduced it as a weekly series in 2005, where it continues to run at this time.\n

He is well known for being the main writer of the popular visual novel Kanon while working under Key. Additional works include Moon., One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e, and Moon Childe. He is also known for being the original concept writer for Sola. He also does work in a doujin circle named Cork Board.

Hisaya Naoki debuted as the main scenario writer for the adult visual novel developer Tactics under Nexton in 1997. He first worked on the company's second title Moon., followed by One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e in 1998. After One's completion, Hisaya and much of the staff who made both Moon. and One, including Maeda Jun, Itaru Hinoue, Shinji Orito, and OdiakeS, left Tactics to work under the video game publishing company Visual Art's where they formed the company Key. At Key, Hisaya worked on the planning and most of the scenario for Kanon, released in 1999, but following the completion of Kanon, quit Key. Afterwards, Hisaya formed a doujin circle and participated at Comiket and C Revo, another comic convention, between 1999 and 2002.

In 2003, Hisaya became involved with the doujin circle ""Black box"" where he was put in charge of their first doujin visual novel Limit Off. Hisaya was even able to write the lyrics for the game's theme song ""Real intention,"" something he had never done before. However, even with anticipation mounting, in August 2003, the project was frozen and has never been restarted again. In 2004, Hisaya started working for the video game company Siesta where he contributed as a sub-writer for their first title Moon Childe released in December 2005.

Afterwards, Hisaya once again quit the company he was working for, but at Comiket 70 in August 2006, it was announced that he would now be working with illustrator Nanao Naru on a series entitled Sola as the main concept writer. When Sola was adapted into an anime in 2007, Hisaya was in charge of five out of fifteen episodes of the screenplay. He is also the author of the Sola manga series, illustrated by Chako Abeno.

Hayashi Hiroki is a director, screenwriter and creator affiliated with noted animation studio AIC.

He started in the animation industry as an animator for classic titles such as Thundercats and Silverhawks, then later moved on to direct anime classics including Bubblegum Crisis OVA 4, Gall Force 2, Sol Bianca 1 and 2 (which he was also the creator of).

His real break came when he worked with Kajishima Masaki as co-creator and director on Tenchi Muyo! for Pioneer LDC Japan.

Hayashi also provided lead direction for a show which he worked on before in a slightly different incarnation, Bubblegum Crisis: Tokyo 2040. Since the success of Tenchi Muyo!, Hayashi has continued to create titles such as El Hazard: the Magnificent World, Battle Athletes and Black Heaven.

In 2001 he was working on Mahou Yuugi (Magical Witchland), a series entirely comprised of 3D computer rendered animation.

It was about three ghosts with different personalities having slapstick adventures in their owner's mansion. She then decided to be a mangaka. Her older brother also wanted to be a mangaka and he submitted all his manga artwork to Garo before shifting to oil painting and passing down his tools to her.\n
\n
After graduating, she married and had two sons. When her younger son was in kindergarten, he had a male classmate with autism. Later, she met the autistic boy's mother who said she wanted him to be a 'cheerful working adult'. This inspired Tobe to create ""With the Light,"" a manga dealing with autistic children. At that time, there were very few manga about disabilities and they never received attention. ""With the Light"" changed perspectives on this issue.\n
\n
Tobe died on January 28, 2010 after going on hiatus from With the Light due to illness.\n

15861,DUSTZ,,9,"DUSTZ was formed around vocalist Ray in October 2005 with his friends from childhood at a French international school. They launched their live performance-oriented activities, mainly performing mixture rock full of street sense that passionately renders their enthusiasm for music. Striking out by integrating French-speaking rap into their music, the band rapidly expanded their fan base by word of mouth, performing successful one-band shows even in their early days. And so they made their much-awaited indie debut with “Future,” which marked #2 on Tower Records’ indie chart and #18 on Japan Countdown, attracting attention among music fans. Second indie single “Lapis lazuli,” released in February 2009, won #1 on Tower Records’ indie chart, which was a dream come true.

On May 27, 2009, DUSTZ released their major debut single “Break &amp; Peace” (ending theme of TV anime Sengoku BASARA). Soon after, they were invited to a French music festival and became the first Japanese band to make a street performance a success, attracting thousands of people. The success continued with the release of second single “Brilliant Day” (used in TV drama Oretachiwa Tenshida! NO ANGEL NO LUCK) on October 7.

2010 saw the departure of the drummer, making DUSTZ a band of three half-Japanese, half-French descent members, namely vocalist Ray, guitarist KenT and bassist Gus. In December that year, they premiered a new key-visual made by three world-renowned creative directors Joji Kojima, Noritaka Tatehana and Koji Shiouchi. Its sensual yet sublime artwork caused sensation in music and fashion industries alike.

On April 6, 2011, DUSTZ released their much-awaited new single entitled “Criez”, which was their first in a year and a half. With French, English and Japanese languages crisscrossing the tune, its new-generation, hybrid rock sound that no one had ever experienced spread around the globe as the first shout of the renewed DUSTZ. On May 21, DUSTZ announced that they would be making the opening theme of BLOOD-C, a high-profile TV anime famous as the collaborative project of CLAMP and Production I.G.
Vocalist Ray has also been appearing in various topical films and dramas as actor Ray Fujita. He is currently acting in Les Misérables, the 100th anniversary gala of the Imperial Garden Theater.

Dustz's first album Trois was released by Epic Records Japan on December 14, 2011

He attended Nihon University and majored in business. His first experience with science fiction was through the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs, and the majority of his works reflect this SF influence. He is also a cat lover, and while cats frequently appear in his works, he had never owned a cat until 2003. He used his first experiences with his cat when he wrote Aru Hi no Zwei.
 
He is less well-known outside of Japan, but that is slowly changing as more and more manga is exported from Japan, even though none of his works have been picked up for publication in North America or Europe as of June 2007.

His artwork has a distinctive, soft style, and it stands out among that of his contemporaries in Japan. He is one of the few mangaka to publish in three of the four major mainstream manga markets in Japan: shōjo, shōnen, and seinen manga. Takemoto was the character designer for several computer and console games as well.

15269,FROGMAN,1971-04-09 00:00:00+00:00,8,"Frogman is the name of a writer, character designer, animator, editor, voice actor, and director who created a Flash-based show known as Himitsu Kessha Taka no Tsume (Eagle Talon Secret Society). The show became an internet sensation in Japan and the studios came calling. Frogman got a TV deal, a movie deal, and rampant merchandising can't be far behind. Frogman's real name is Ryo Ono who set out to prove that with the right talent and ambition, an entire studio wasn't necessary to produce enticing works.

Unlike other Japanese animation, drawn meticulously to make the images look real, his characters — made with Adobe Flash software designed for creating Web page animations — only move horizontally and their facial expressions do not change.

In this way, he could create a five-minute animated movie in a week with little overhead.

In 2004, Ono uploaded a sample of his first five-minute short, titled ""Sguy &amp; The Family Stone,"" on his Web site. The animation, whose title came from the American funk and rock band Sly &amp; The Family Stone of the 1960s, gained popularity by word of mouth.

With the success of his Web animation work, he moved back to Tokyo to work on a new series titled ""Coffy the Tomb Tyke,"" a romantic comedy of ancient Japanese tomb characters, and ""The Eagle Talon Secret Society,"" a comedy about an evil society called Eagle Talon (the alternate Japanese title is ""Taka no Tsume,"" which means red pepper). TV Asahi broadcast both for three months in 2006.

His works are unique in that they are comedic with satirical elements.

In 2006, his short animation series ""Kaeruotoko Gekijo"" (""The Frogman Theater"") that satirizes Japanese politics was broadcast on the popular TBS TV news program ""NEWS23.""

Vision (ADV), paving the way for other businesses and the exponential growth anime has had within North America. With ADV's success, Ledford turned his sights to making the imaginative world of anime even more accessible with Anime Network's founding, North America’s first cable TV network dedicated to anime. 

He partnered with Kadokawa Publishing and began Newtype USA with translated Japanese content and exclusive U.S. material related to all things anime, manga, and model reviews. This endeavor expanded into ADV Manga, which obtained licensing and publishing rights for hundreds of Japanese manga and Korean manhwa.

In 2008, Ledford founded a new anime-focused company called Sentai Filmworks (Sentai). Since its founding, Sentai provides thousands of hours of content across traditional and digital platforms.

Ledford’s most recent success is with the 2017 founding of the streaming service HIDIVE. Since launching, HIDIVE is now available via a web browser, mobile devices, gaming platforms, and more. HIDIVE offers new simulcasts every season, an ever-growing collection of dubs, and exclusive titles. The service features DUBCAST SM editions, early access local-language dubs of simulcasts directly produced by HIDIVE, as early as two weeks after the original Japanese broadcast.

For nearly thirty years now, Ledford continues his goal to further the expansion of anime and the Japanese culture as a whole.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/17169.jpg

He also appeared in television series and specials, and was the first guest on the television talk show Tetsuko's Room in 1975, beginning its ongoing (as of 2006) 31-year run. He was long-time head of the Japan Actors Union. Among many honors, Morishige received the Order of Culture from the Emperor of Japan in 1991.

32459,ZONE,,7,"ZONE (ゾーン) was an all-female pop rock band started in Sapporo, Japan in 1999. Though it initially started as a dance group, they turned to an all female band. Zone has been categorized in a new genre called ""bandol"" (a portmanteau of the words band and idol). The band was started by Studio RunTime and released their first single under the major record label Sony Records, ""Good Days"", on February 7, 2001.

Their most famous song is ""Secret Base: Kimi ga Kureta Mono"" released on August 8, 2001. The single sold about 744,000 copies on Japanese Oricon charts.

At first, Zone started off with eight members in 1997, then reduced to six and finally four - these members were Nagase Miyu, Saito Mizuho, Sakae Maiko, and Ookoshi Takayo - by the time they released their first indie disc in 1999.

Ominami Tadayuki, a representative of Sony Records, noticed that the crowd reaction to the debut concert was particularly enthusiastic. Back then, Zone was solely concentrated on singing and dancing. Following his belief that Zone had the makings of a hit, Tadayuki watched a live video of the band playing with instruments at the KomeKome Klub and felt that, due to the overabundance of dance groups, Zone had the makings of a breakthrough act, providing they could play their instruments as well as sing and dance.

In late 2003, Ookoshi Takayo announced her graduation from Zone to pursue her studies and has been since replaced by Nishimura Tomoka, one of the two original members cut from the band when they scaled from six members to four.

Between 1999 and 2005, Zone released seventeen hit singles, three full lengths CDs, three DVDs, did commercials, and had their own television special, in addition to attending high school. They all graduated.

Zone officially disbanded on April 1, 2005, after playing their final concert at Nippon Budokan. On April 13, their greatest hits album E: Complete A Side Singles was released. The album debuted at #1 with the first week sales of about 98,000 copies, becoming their first number-one album on Japanese Oricon charts.

Before the year was up, the group released their first single, ""Sabishisa wa Aki no Iro"", in December. Two years later after the release of their third single, Ohshima left the group to join the music unit SO-FI, leaving the band to replace him with Kimura Shinya to start the second generation.

The group's first hit was the single ""Sekaijuu no Dare Yori Kitto"" with Nakayama Miho and later the album Toki no Bira, which sold over a million copies. By 1993, the group became one of the top artists of Japan by selling over 7 million copies of their singles and albums by the end of the year. They also scored their first award at that year's Japan Record Awards.

The group started to write, compose, and arrange their music in 1995, starting with the album PIECE OF MY SOUL. A year later after the release of their eleventh single, Uesugi and Shibasaki left the group and later form the unit al.ni.co. The group hired Waku and Sugimoto to replace the two and start the second generation of WANDS.

In March 2000, the group disbanded for unknown reasons, and active again in 2018 with Shibasaki and Ooshima inviting the new vocalist Daishi Uehara.  Then keyboard changed from Ooshima to Kimura.

He committed suicide on July 30, 1996 by jumping from his seventh-story window at the age of 31. This occurred shortly after recording the Macross World Radio Show. He remained a friend of fellow Macross cast member and pop singer Iijima Mari after the series ended and frequently attended her concerts up until his death.

In 2005, Iijima reprised her role of Lynn Minmay for the ADV Films English dub release of Macross, and in interviews has stated that she is dedicating this new release to him.

During his active career he was a member of Sigma Club (シグマクラブ) and Production MThree (プロダクション・エムスリー).

Shintani is best known for his series Area 88, which is widely recognized as one of the finest aviator comic titles in the history of manga. In addition to his very popular pilot comics, Shintani has successfully ventured into science fiction, fantasy, comedy, and hentai comics as well. In 1985, he was awarded the Shogakukan Manga Award for shounen for Area 88 and Futari Daka.\n
\n
Shintani began his career in 1972 as a shoujo artist and was nominated for the Ribon Comics Award for best new artist of that year. After working as an assistant to Leiji Matsumoto, the writer and artist of Captain Harlock and Space Battleship Yamato, Shintani began to publish aviator titles in various comic magazines. Serialization of Area 88 began in 1979 and the title has been popular ever since.\n
\n
While working as an assistant to Matsumoto, one of Shintani's duties was to construct plastic models for drawing reference. Matsumoto often states that he based the character Yattaran (who appears as a supporting character in several Harlock stories) on Shintani.\n

He is married to Saeki Kayono and sometimes provides illustrations for her manga.\n

Sugaya Risako was born April 4, 1994 in Zushi, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. She is a pop singer, idol, and a member of Japanese musical group Berryz Koubou.

In 2002, Sugaya successfully passed the Hello! Project Kids Audition. Her debut within the Hello! Project world came with the premiere of the first Minimoni feature film, as part of 4Kids, a shuffles group formed exclusively for the movie.

In 2003, Sugaya starred in the movie Hotaru no Hoshi (蛍の星), as Hikari, a fragile elementary school student who, with the help of her caring teacher, has a chance to be momentarily reunited with her deceased mother and overcome her emotional problems. She also starred in the drama, Shonan Kawarayane Monogatari.

That year also marked her first appearance on Kouhaku Uta Gassen, as one of Aya Matsuura's backup dancers, during the 54th edition of the renowned NHK New Year program.

In early 2004, Sugaya became part of the newly formed group Berryz Koubou. Since joining the group, she has also participated in the band's weekly radio show Berryz Koubou Kiritsu! Rei! Chakuseki!.

She has also, like other Hello! Project members, appeared in the Musume Dokyu! segments, namely episodes 39, 40, 54, 55, and 56.

Additionally, Sugaya has done a commercial for the Nihon Shokuniku Shouhi Sougou Center in October 2003.

In August 2006, Sugaya was interviewed by MC Maki Goto in the 12th installment of the online only show Hello! Pro Hour. She later re-appeared alongside Momoko Tsugunaga on the 20th and final episode.

On October 12, 2006, Sugaya became the first member of Berryz Koubou, and the youngest of all the Hello! Project members, to release a solo photobook. Even prior to its release, the photobook was met with mixed feelings both by Japanese and overseas fans. Sugaya herself admitted, in an interview with Sanspo.com, to initially having doubts regarding the photoshoot, but claims to have had a pleasant experience and hopes her fans enjoy the various facets of her personality.

On December 31, 2006, Sugaya once again took the stage at the 57th NHK Kouhaku Uta Gassen as a backup dancer in Morning Musume's performance of Aruiteru, along with the remaining members of Berryz Koubou, Country Musume and C-ute.

In mid-2009, Sugaya became a member of new unit Guardians 4.

22533,Toshio Hirata,1938-02-16 00:00:00+00:00,6,"Hirata Toshio was an animator and a graduate of Musashino Art University. After graduation in 1961 he joined Toei Douga, but left it soon after. Since then he has worked for Mushi Production, Zuiyo, Group Tac, and currently resides in Madhouse.


Like many of the figures of this period, Hirata started his career as an animator at Toei Doga as an inbetweener in the features made from 1960 to 1963: Journey to the West, Anju, Sinbad, Little Prince. Specifically, he was under the tutelage of Yasuji Mori. Hirata still speaks extremely highly of the experience and of Mori in particular, going so far as to say that if it hadn't been for Mori, he probably wouldn't be in animation today. Mori was a major influence on Hirata -- as well as many of those who worked with him like Miyazaki and Takahata -- not only because he was a great teacher and animator himself, but also because he was a gentle person who, legend has it, never got angry at anyone. He took animation seriously, and approached it with rigor and love. Mori's legacy is clearly at the root of Hirata's pliant, honest, soulful approach to animation.

One of the things that is unique about this early period is the variety of origins of the animators. In other words, today people come to anime because they've seen anime; but back then, during the early Toei Doga period, there was no TV anime, so many of the people who entered Toei Doga did so because they had seen a few Disney pics in the theater, or animated ads on TV, or Hakujaden, etc.. Yet other people simply happened to wander in almost by accident, having studied art at school, and maybe having casually seen an animated film or two, but otherwise knowing nothing about animation. Toshio Hirata falls into the latter group.

Anime then was not yet anime; it was a bunch of young people making tentative steps to figure out what they could do with animation. They were blissfully free of the burdensome history that nowadays blinkers many in the anime industry. Thus could we get films like Little Prince &amp; the 8-Headed Dragon and Gulliver's Space Travels that are full of inventive artistic ideas. Hirata was one of the many people just out of art school who happened to find their way to Toei Doga for whatever reason. Together with a lot of those people, he was drawn to the Animation Sannin no Kai during his Toei Doga period, 1960-1963. If he learned the traditional approach to animation at Toei Doga, the experience of seeing those films broadened his understanding of animation and added an artistic side to his approach. The graphically-oriented aspect of his subsequent output can definitively be traced to this experience.

Hirata began his Mushi Pro period in 1966 directing episodes of Jungle Taitei immediately after his involvement in Ken the Wolf Boy at Toei Doga in 1965. His experience at Mushi Pro was a fateful one for him, second to his experience at Toei Doga only in chronological order. Interestingly enough, at Mushi Pro he was automatically started out as a key animator, and the very next year, for Jungle Taitei in 1966, he was bumped up to directing! Ironically, when he helped out on Toei Doga's Gulliver around the same time in 1965, he was bumped back to inbetweening. Apparently credit wasn't transferrable between studios. This is basically attributable to the rather unique system at Mushi Pro that reflected Tezuka's creator-based approach. Tasks weren't clear-cut and heirarchically organized the way they were at Toei Doga; people did various things as necessary, and consequently accession to key animation and directing could be absurdly fast (though, really, the reason for the ad-hoc nature of the studio basically comes down to the shortage of staff).

9668,Mark Mancina,1957-03-09 00:00:00+00:00,5,"Mark Richard Mancina (born March 9, 1957 in Santa Monica, California) is a U.S. composer, primarily for Hollywood soundtracks, such as his collaboration with Trevor Rabin on the soundtrack for Con Air. He arranged many of the songs behind Disney's The Lion King (while Hans Zimmer wrote the orchestral score with Lebo M for the African chants) including the Broadway musical. He also notably composed the score for the thriller Twister (1996) as well as the blockbuster action films Speed (1994) and Bad Boys (1995).

Trained as a classical guitarist, he is an avid guitar and rare instrument collector.

Mancina collaborated with John Van Tongeren to write the theme to the 1995 revival of The Outer Limits. They both scored ten episodes for the first season of the show.

He also collaborated with Phil Collins on two feature animated films for Disney, Tarzan and Brother Bear.

Mancina has also been associated with a number of progressive rock projects. He toured with Rabin in support of Rabin's Can't Look Away album and then went on to produce tracks on the Yes album Union. He has also worked with Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer.

He is known to be influenced by The Beatles, favoring their early years.

Mancina also composed the music for the popular 2005-2006 anime TV series BLOOD+, which had music produced by Hans Zimmer.

After searching, they found Ikemori Shuuichi and decided to give him a test run. After they found him good to go, they hurried to find a keyboardist and found Yamane Koji. They released their first single months later, entitled ""Kono Mama Kimi Dake wo Ubaisaritai"", and it did exceptionally well as it climbed to #2 on the weekly Oricon charts. They released their next single, ""Tsubasa wo Hirogete"", soon after and it hit #1.

The members began to experiment their musically ability and began to compose their own songs. Their first composed single, ""Mirai no Tame ni"", was released in 1995 and made #1 on the charts. They also released singles for such anime Dragonball GT and Meitantei Conan during the same time. They also participated in the song ""Giniro no Yume ~All over the world~"" for the 1996 Olympics.

In 1998, the music unit released their first best album, SINGLES+1. They also changed labels from B-Gram Records to BMG Japan during the same year. By the end of the decade, DEEN ranked #49 on Artists Sale Ranking.

With the start of the new millennium, the music unit started to self-produce their works. Two years later, they released their first ballad album, Ballads in Blue ~The greatest hits of DEEN~, and then released their first cover album, Waon ~Songs for Childen~. They also sang the theme song for the soccer team Tokyo Verdy 1969 in 2004.

In 2006, DEEN released the single ""Diamond"", the theme song to the PS2 video game Tales of Destiny. A year later, they re-released their older concerts that used be video-only onto DVD. They also performed at the Tales of Festival 2008 in 2008, this time to promote the single ""Yume de Aetara"" that was used in a Tales of Destiny commercial. They also celebrate their 15th anniversary by releasing a best album, DEEN PERFECT SINGLES +, and releasing their first live album, entitled DEEN at Budoukan ""NO CUT"" ~15th Anniversary Perfect Singles Live~.

3973,Miyuki Miyabe,1960-12-23 00:00:00+00:00,3,"Miyabe Miyuki, born December 23, 1960 is a popular contemporary Japanese author active in a number of genres that include science fiction, mystery fiction, historical fiction, social commentary, and juvenile fiction. Her most famous novels in the English-speaking world are Crossfire (クロスファイア), published in 1998, and Kasha (火車), translated by Alfred Birnbaum as All She Was Worth, published in 1999. Amongst anime fans, her fantasy novel Brave Story is well-regarded; it has notably been adapted into an animated film, an ""alternate retelling"" manga series, and a series of video games.\n
\n
Miyabe was born in the Koutou ward of Tokyo, Japan and graduated from Sumidagawa High School. She started writing novels at the age of 23. In 1984, while working at a law office, Miyabe began to take writing classes at a writing school run by the Kodansha publishing company. Her debut work is considered to be her 1987 short story Warera ga rinjin no hanzai (我らが隣人の犯罪). She has been a prolific writer, publishing dozens of novels and winning many major literary prizes, including the Yamamoto Shuugorou Prize in 1993 for Kasha and the Naoki Prize in 1998 for Riyuu (理由 The Reason). A Japanese film adaptation of Riyuu, directed by Nobuhiko Obayashi, was released in 2004 (reviewed by Mark Schilling in The Japan Times (5 January 2005)).\n

Yoshimitsu Yamashita graduated from Kokugakuin University with a Major in History. Yamashita first started out in the Anime industry in 1997 working in Production Management at JCF. Amazingly, he has never been formally trained in art. His talent for drawing was first discovered through various doodles and sketches he would make on company paperwork.

Yamashita’s first project as an animator was Kochira Katsushika-ku Kamearikouen-mae Hashutsujo The Movie 2. He continued to work at JCF for several years, and then made the leap to becoming a freelance animator. Samurai Champloo was the first project he worked on freelance. Around 2006, Yamashita joined BeeTrain and started work as Character Designer and Animation Director on the TV show Ginyuu Mokushiroku Meine Liebe wieder. A short while later, the Animation Department at BeeTrain was spun off into new company, C-Station, and Yamashita moved with it. Today Yamashita retains a seat at C-Station, but regularly contracts out to work on various external projects.

A  Japanese musician, his music career began on February 1, 1984 with ""Monica"" (later remade in Cantonese sung by Leslie Cheung) and he won 8 music awards in the same year. After taking a short break in 1988, he came back as a lead singer in the band Complex with Tomoyasu Hotei (former guitarist of Boøwy) and ""Be My Baby"" was released.

After ""Complex"", Koji released series of hit singles such as ""Setsunasa O Korosenai"", ""Kiss Ni Utarete Nemuritai"" and ""Boy's Life"". Koji completed a ""20th Anniversary Tour"" at Budokan on February 1, 2005.

His albums are always different through experimenting and reinventing. It is considered without doubt that rock is his form of sound and genre. He is an icon in his own rights-be it in fashion or music. Until now, he is renowned for his live concerts-where he sounds better live-due to his dynamic showmanship &amp; stamina.

43206,Dream,2000-01-01 00:00:00+00:00,2,"Dream is a Japanese pop girl group signed to the Avex Trax label since 2000 and Rhythm Zone since 2009. The group was formed as a result of a 1999 talent contest called ""Avex Dream 2000"". Originally a three-piece group consisting of Mai Matsumuro, Kana Tachibana, and Yu Hasebe, the group has undergone many changes since its debut in 2000 on the Avex Trax label, and none of the original trio remain. The original trio sold over 950,700 records, and in total the group has sold over 1,100,000 records over the span of 10 years.

On July 7, 2002, the main lyricist Mai Matsumuro left the group to pursue a solo career. After Matsumuro's departure, Avex held another audition to replace Matsumuro. Instead of one, six new members won the audition, resulting in an eight-member (Dream) group with the debut single ""Music is My Thing"". On March 2004, Risa Ai left to pursue a solo career. They became a 7-member group as performed this way until 2007. During this time, the band's name changed from dream to DRM. In August 2008, Yu Hasebe left the group to pursue a solo career, leaving Kana Tachibana behind as the only original member of dream. Afterward, DRM became Dream again.

\n
After spending years as a dump truck driver, free writer, and musician, he made his debut as a mystery writer in 1981 when The Tokyo Zodiac Murders remained as a finalist in the Edogawa Rampo Award. His most well-known works include the Detective Mitarai Series and the Detective Yoshiki Series. His works often involve themes such as the death penalty, Nihonjinron (his theory on the Japanese people), and Japanese and international culture. He is a strong supporter of amateur Honkaku (i.e. authentic, orthodox) mystery writers.\n
\n
Following the trend of Social School of crime fiction led by Seicho Matsumoto, he was the pioneer of ""Shin-Honkaku"" (New Orthodox) logic mystery genre. He bred authors such as Yukito Ayatsuji, Rintaro Norizuki and Shogo Utano, and he led the mystery boom from the late 1980s to present day. As the father of ""Shin-Honkaku,"" Shimada is sometimes referred to as ""The Godfather of Shin-Honkaku"" or ""God of Mystery.""\n

13629,Stella Bagwell,,1,"Stella began her writing career almost by accident. Although she always loved reading romances, she never thought to write one herself. She was a hairdresser and worked in her sister’s beauty shop. Ironically, Stella developed a severe allergy to hairspray and was forced to resign.

With time on her hands, she wanted to do something creative. She remembered a high school English teacher telling her she could be a writer if she wanted. Armed with that notion and an old, manual typewriter, she went to work, attempting to create a story similar to those she liked reading.

The result —her first book, purchased by Mills &amp; Boon and issued under the Harlequin imprint. After that, Stella became a full time writer and today, has close to forty published novels.

When she was seventeen, Stella married her high school sweetheart: Harrell. This year, they are celebrating their twenty-ninth wedding anniversary. One of her greatest joys was to see Jason, her only son, graduate from college with degrees in math and physical education. He now lives in Port Lavaca, Texas, where he teaches high school algebra and geometry and coaches football and weightlifting.

The couple has always lived in southeastern Oklahoma. Recently, they purchased a portion of a twenty-two hundred, acre ranch; they now make their home there. The closest town of three thousand is fifteen miles away; Stella says she loves the seclusion, living among the woods and horses and wildlife. The only thing she doesn’t like is making the thirty mile round trip to the post office or grocery store. Worse still, is the eighty-five mile trip to get office supplies!

Next to writing, traveling is one of her most favorite activities. Yet, because the southwest is dear to her heart, she sets most of her books there in rough, rugged ranch country. She feels it’s essential to know a place before writing about it; that philosophy gives her more reason to plan trips!

In her spare time, Stella enjoys practicing violin and guitar, both of which she can play by ear. She claims to need years of practice before calling herself a musician. Stella also enjoys gardening and being outdoors. Before moving onto the ranch, she had a swimming pool in her back yard and spent most of her summer evenings in the water. Her husband has promised to put in another pool, but for now she has to make do with the creek that runs through their property.

Family has always come first with Stella and she enjoys spending time with her son when he visits Oklahoma. Sometimes, she and her husband drive down to the Texas coast to see him. However, her mother, step-father and siblings all live nearby and they have routine get-togethers.

Stella’s plan for the future is to continue writing romance novels as long as there’s an audience to enjoy her work.

30117,Masako Natsume,1957-12-17 00:00:00+00:00,1,"Natsume Masako (December 17, 1957 - September 11, 1985) (family name: Nishiyama) was a Japanese model and actress from Tokyo. Widely popular in Japan she gained worldwide recognition for her portrayal of Tripitaka in the TV series Monkey which is now considered a cult classic.

Masako was born Odate Masako in Roppongi, Tokyo, the only daughter of Sue and Odate Kazu. Raised in Naka-ku, Yokohama, while in junior college in 1976 she auditioned for the lead in Nihon TV's Ai Ga Miemasu Ka?. Chosen from 4,000 applicants, she dropped out of school to pursue an acting career, playing the part under her real name Odate Masako. Masako's mother initially objected to her choice of career and requested that she not use the Odate family name if she gained further work. In 1977, she changed her name to Natsume.
In 1977, she was chosen to represent Kanebo Cosmetics, achieving great popularity after appearing topless as the ""Kooky Face"" girl in an ad for sunscreen. This popularity led to her recording a song later that year called ""Oh! Cookie Face"". Many bit parts and a few leads in movies followed but she continued in television.
In 1978-79, she played the male part of Tripitaka (Sanzō-hōshi, Japanese translation of Sanzang-fashi) in the 1970s Japanese TV program Saiyūki, which proved popular in many English-speaking countries in the 1980s, when dubbed by the BBC and titled Monkey. Masako won the part as she had matched contemporary descriptions of Sanzō-hōshi's appearance more closely than male actors who auditioned.
Masako made her stage debut with the Tokyo-Takarazuka Theater Company in 1980 in the play ""Kikaishi Naporeon No Taishoku"".
Specialising as well bred but shy heroines in her movies she was regularly criticized by the public and media for her poor acting. However, this changed in 1982 after appearing as an ambitious and immoral woman in the TV drama ""Shousha"" and as the daughter of a Yakuza leader in the movie ""Onimasa"". One of her lines from this movie ""Don't you shit with me!"" became a very popular catchphrase in Japan.
She won the award for best actress at the 8th Hochi Film Award for The Catch and Time and Tide.
She died from acute leukemia at the age of 27 in 1985 and is buried in Dairakuji Temple in Hōfu, Yamaguchi under the name Masako Nishiyama.
Masako Natsume picture books and calendars are still popular in Japan today. In 1997, Canon produced a television commercial for a copy machine, featuring her photocopied images, which offered 100 free compilations of the images in a book. Canon received 230,000 applications.
In 2007, TBS broadcast a documentary on Masako's life titled ""Himawari - Masako Natsume 27 - sai no Shougai to Haha no Ai"" based on the book ""Futari no Masako"" written by her mother, Sue Odate. The documentary stars Yagi Yūki as Natsume in her childhood and Nakama Yukie as a grown Natsume.

Born in Shizuoka, Gon Nakayama attended Fujieda Higashi High School and Tsukuba University before he joined Jubilo Iwata of the Japan Football League, a precursor to the J. League, which consisted of company sponsored teams. He retired in December 2012 at age 45 after playing 3 seasons for Consadole Sapporo.

Playing as a Forward, Nakayama made his J. League debut on 11 March 1994. From then until 2009, he was an ever-present part of the Jubilo lineup as they were consistently one of the top teams in the J. League since its inception. With a strike-rate of more than a goal every two games throughout his career, Nakayama was the inspirational and talismanic leader for both Jubilo Iwata and the Japanese national team.

At the 1998 FIFA World Cup finals in France, Nakayama scored the only goal of the tournament and the first goal for Japan in the history of the World Cup against Jamaica on 26 June 1998. As of 2009, he has scored 21 goals in 53 appearances for the Japanese national team, which places him 8th all-time among goalscorers for his country.

Nakayama also holds the world record fastest hat-trick at international level. He managed three goals in an AFC Asian Cup qualification match against Brunei on 16 February 2000 in only three minutes and three seconds, beating the previous record of Englishman George William Hall set in 1938 (against Ireland) by 27 seconds. This striker becomes a record-holder with other hat-tricks, that he did it in four successive games of J.League, from 15 to 29 April in 1998. He scored 16 times in these games. The record is recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records.

Affectionately known as Gon, Nakayama is a fan favorite among many casual Japanese football fans for his outspoken and humorous nature. Now in the twilight of his career, injuries and age have taken a toll on Nakayama's skills but he still remains a favorite of the Jubilo faithful, as evidenced by the fact that he draws the loudest cheers by far from the home crowd at Yamaha Stadium when his name is announced during warm-ups or when he comes on as a substitute.

On 4 December 2012, he announced his retirement at the age of 45, citing injuries to his both knees, after making J. League's all-time leading scores of 157 goals.",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/voiceactors/2/32785.jpg

Frank Baum, was an American author chiefly known for his children's books, particularly The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. He wrote thirteen novel sequels, nine other fantasy novels, and a host of other works (55 novels in total, plus four ""lost"" novels, 83 short stories, over 200 poems, an unknown number of scripts, and many miscellaneous writings), and made numerous attempts to bring his works to the stage and screen. His works anticipated such century-later commonplaces as television, augmented reality, laptop computers (The Master Key), wireless telephones (Tik-Tok of Oz), women in high risk, action-heavy occupations (Mary Louise in the Country), and the ubiquity of advertising on clothing (Aunt Jane's Nieces at Work).

Henriksen was born in Manhattan, New York City to a poor family. His father was a Norwegian merchant sailor and boxer nicknamed ""Icewater"" who spent most of his life at sea. Henriksen’s mother struggled to find work as a dance instructor, waitress, and model.[1][2] His parents divorced when he was only two years old and he was raised by his mother from then on. As he grew up, Henriksen found himself in trouble at various schools and even saw the inside of a children's home. Henriksen left home and dropped out of school at the age of twelve. He was illiterate until the age of 30, when he taught himself to read by studying film scripts.[3] He spent most of his adolescence as a street urchin in New York. Riding on freight trains across the country, he would also do time in jail for petty crimes such as vagrancy. It was during this period of wayfaring that he met lifetime friends James Cameron and Bruce Kenselaar. ETC ETC.\n

She is an original Team K member and debuted on April 1, 2006. She was regrouped to Team B at the final Budokan Concert in August, 2009 and was again regrouped to Team A at the Tokyo Dome Concert on August 24, 2012.

Sato has been included in the AKB48 sub-group ""Ice from AKB48"" with Erena Ono, Yūko Ōshima, Tomomi Kasai, and Yuu Imai which recorded the theme song Aisareru to iu Koto for ICE (アイサレルトイウコト for ICE) used in the anime ICE.
In 2007 and 2008, Sato joined Kayo Noro to create the comedian duo Nacchinon (「なちのん」). They participated in multiple comedy competitions, but never placed.

On December 20, 2008 at AKB48's first concert in JCB Hall, it was announced that Sato would be studying at Waseda University in Tokyo.

Sato has appeared on the TV quiz show Q-Sama!! multiple times. In her first appearance, she was partnered with Sakiko Matsui, the only other college student in AKB48 at the time.

On May 4, 2010, Sato was officially announced as being under the management of Watanabe Productions' Biscuit Entertainment. As of May 28, 2010, she was allowed an official public blog hosted on her agency's site.

On July 11, 2010, Sato was announced to have been grouped into the ""Girls・ING"" (「ガールズ・ING」) unit for the Ameba Team Pigg Unit Battle as a chance to participate in AKB48's 18th major label single, ""Beginner,"" as one of the B-sides. Other members chosen for the unit are Ayaka Umeda, Ayaka Kikuchi, Asuka Kuramochi, Haruna Kojima, and Rina Chikano. ""Girls・ING"" achieved third place in the tournament with 108,575 votes, and did not get to use their song ""Uso Desho?"" (「嘘でしょ？」), which would be a ""quick-paced pop song about girls' feelings. The song was later released at the beginning of 2011 in No3b's first self-titled album, due to Kojima Haruna's inclusion in both units.

Roughly a week later on July 18, 2010, Sato announced that she would have a lead position in an annual September production of ""Imagine9.11,"" a play which focuses on terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001. She played a girl named Sato who suffered from leukemia and also was the center of the idol group SM8 (Sugar Moon 8).

AKB48 held a luck-based tournament to be selected for positions in the 19th major label single, Chance no Junban (「チャンスの順番」) on September 21, 2010. There, AKB48 members played Jankenpon, or Rock-Paper-Scissors. Sato won seventh place in the contest and was then selected for a single for the second time, the first being the 3rd major label single in April, 2007.
For AKB48's fourth annual Top 100 concert, the series of four performances showcasing the 100 most popular fan-voted songs, Sato was announced to be in Team Z, a 16-girl promotional sub-unit for a pachinko game coming out shortly after with their song ""Koi no Onawa"" (「恋のお縄」).

In July and August, 2011, Sato performed her third musical, ""Dump Show"". In this musical, she is double cast as a lead in the Moon pair along with Amina Sato in opposition the Sun pair of Oya Shizuka and Asuka Kuramochi, with Oya sharing her part. Sato plays Akane, the lead character's childhood friend.

Natsuki is on a regular radio show with MC Minshiru, ""Asian K-Pop Powered by Love-1"" on Tokyo FM. She also hosts the weather segment of popular news show ""Hiruobi"" on TBS every week.

On November 30, 2012, Sato Natsuki announced her graduation from AKB48 and from the entertainment industry in order to focus on her university studies and future career.

She was part of the J-Pop group Aurora Gonin Musume. When she married to Kirihara Tetsuhito in 1998, Chiba's legal name became Kirihara Reiko (桐原 麗子). However, she continues to be known by either her maiden name or ""Chibarei"" in business and other public contexts.

Chiba was born in Osaka, and raised in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. She was a model in her teens, and made her J-Pop debut on 7 April 1993, but retired from the entertainment industry in 1995. Her hobbies included computer games and online communications. She was featured in a nightly radio show ""Akihabara Young Denkikan"". Chiba did a cameo voice appearance as herself in the anime movie Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture.

One of Chiba's most notable roles was Mei/PteraRanger in the Toei Super Sentai series Kyouryuu Sentai Zyuranger and Cham Cham in the Samurai Shodown series.

Since her 1998 marriage and the birth of a son in 1999, Chiba has adopted a more mature public persona. She is now active as a certified yoga instructor, teaching yoga classes and issuing a series of instructional books and videos. She is also the public face of the corporation Cherrybabe, Inc.

The band disbanded on March 1, 2009.

Jero began singing Enka at the age of six and continued to study the Japanese language all throughout high school and college. He also studied Japanese for some time at the Kansai Gaidai University school of foreign languages. Jero majored in information science at University of Pittsburgh and graduated in 2003, and moved to Japan in the same year. Two months after arriving in Japan, he entered the NHK Nodo Jiman competition broadcast on TV. 

His grandmother, originally from Yokohama, Japan, first introduced Jero to Enka and it was under her guidance that he grew to love the genre as a child. Jero, who majored in information technology at the University of Pittsburgh, did not initially imagine himself in a career as an Enka singer. Rather, after he permanently moved to Japan, his main forms of employment were as an English teacher at NOVA and as a computer engineer. He only began to actively work towards becoming an Enka singer because he had promised his grandmother that one day he would someday perform at the annual Kohaku Uta Gassen song show. As a result, he actively participated in numerous singing contests while he continued to work as a computer engineer and eventually achieved real success after only two months since he had arrived in Japan. His grandmother never was able to see her grandson achieve Enka fame, she died in 2005, three years before he became famous.

In 2018, Jero announced that he was taking an indefinite hiatus from his music career to focus on a career in computers.

54198,Vincenzo Draghi,1952-03-15 00:00:00+00:00,0,"Birthplace: Voghera, Italy

His first public performance dates back to the early years of childhood, at the age of four. In fact, he made his debut in theatrical events in northern Italy with an accordion given to him by his parents and at the age of five he learned the rudiments of written music.

The advent of free radio led Enzo Draghi to write jingles and music for advertising as well as commercials for numerous Italian television stations. The 70s influence his style of writing and composition, groups such as Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Gentle Giant or even Eric Clapton's blues will become part of his musical background.

With the arrival in Fininvest, the artist begins to deal, in addition to writing and arranging the music, also with the artistic production and musical direction of singing performances of various Italian television personalities such as Gerry Scotti, Lino Banfi, Luca Barbareschi and many others.

During 1985, he recieves a call and is asked to record the italian versions for the japanese songs in Aishite Knight. Alessandra Valeri Manera will remain satisfied with his work, thus beginning a collaboration between him, Valeri Manera and Cristina D'Avena that will eventually lead to the recording of ""L'incorreggibile Lupin"", one of the most iconic anime songs.
